## Current Schema (from your notes)
```yaml

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Timestamps (Immediate)
- Add `created`, `updated`, `last_reviewed` to all notes
- Display these in the UI prominently
- Sort by these fields in the notes index

### Phase 2: Content Metrics (Week 1)
- Calculate `word_count`, `reading_time` automatically
- Count `connection_count` and `backlink_count`
- Show reading time in note headers

### Phase 3: SEO Enhancement (Week 1-2)
- Add proper meta descriptions
- Generate Open Graph images automatically
- Add structured data markup (JSON-LD)
- Implement canonical URLs

### Phase 4: Provenance Tracking (Week 2-3)
- Track `source`, `transcript_id`, `agent_version`
- Add manual edit indicators
- Create changelog/history view

### Phase 5: Connection Intelligence (Week 3-4)
- Auto-suggest `related_notes` using similarity
- Track connection density over time
- Create "most connected" views

## UI Improvements Based on Schema

### Note Header Enhancement
```html
<header class="note-header">
  <h1>{{title}}</h1>
  <div class="note-meta">
    <span class="reading-time">{{reading_time}} min read</span>
    <span class="status-badge status-{{status}}">{{status}}</span>
    <time class="updated" datetime="{{updated}}">Updated {{updated | humanize}}</time>
    {{#if manual_edits}}
    <span class="edit-indicator" title="Manually refined">✏️</span>
    {{/if}}
  </div>
  {{#if summary}}
  <p class="note-summary">{{summary}}</p>
  {{/if}}
</header>
```

### Browse by Recency Views
- **Recent Updates**: Notes sorted by `updated` desc
- **Fresh Thoughts**: Notes sorted by `created` desc  
- **Review Queue**: Notes where `needs_review` is true
- **Dense Connections**: Notes sorted by `connection_count` desc

### Connection Density Indicators
- Show connection count as badges
- Visual indicators for highly connected notes
- "Connection suggestions" based on similar content

This schema supports your vision of:
1. **Atomic notes** with clear provenance
2. **Dense connections** with metrics and tracking  
3. **AI-assisted workflow** with transparency about edits
4. **Discovery and browsing** based on recency and connections
5. **SEO optimization** for the "digital garden collection" goal
6. **Quality tracking** for continuous improvement

The schema grows with your system - start with timestamps and metrics, then add intelligence and social features as you build toward the subscription tiers.
