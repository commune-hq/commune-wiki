# Note-Writing Bible

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16

This document codifies the principles for writing notes in Devon's wiki. As we edit and refine, this Bible evolves.

## The Bylaws

### 1. Titles are takeaways, not labels
- **Bad**: "Self-hosting"
- **Good**: "Box-first earns trust"
- **Why**: A title should read like a conclusion. The claim in the title forces clarity in the body.
- **Test**: If you cannot name the claim, split the note or think more.

### 2. Atomic notes (one idea per note)
- **Rule**: Each note expresses exactly one idea
- **Why**: Makes notes reusable, composable, and maintainable
- **Test**: Ask "What's the ONE idea here?" If multiple, split.

###3. Associative linking over hierarchies
- **Rule**: Connect via WikiLinks `[[Like This]]`, not folders
- **Why**: Ideas connect in networks, not trees
- **Pattern**: Dense linking creates the knowledge graph

### 4. Target 150-250 words
- **Range**: Aim for tight, direct notes
- **Why**: Forces focus, prevents drift into multiple topics
- **Exception**: Some notes need more context, but bias toward brevity

### 5. Proper nouns get their own notes
- **Examples**: "Awake Happy", "Ads Lab", "The Star", "Matt", "Joel"
- **Why**: Lets you talk about what that thing/person means to you
- **Pattern**: The note describes the relationship, then links to 3-5 new concepts
- **External links**: Go IN the note, not as the note itself

## Voice & Style

### Use Devon's voice
- Direct, not robotic
- Active voice over passive
- "Reach for" over "reference" or "indicate"
- "Sits in the top 5%" over "is in the top 5%"
- No corporate-speak or AI drift

### Avoid these words
- "Indicating" - too boring
- "Contains" - icky
- "Leveraging" - corporate
- "Synergy" - kill it with fire

### Prefer these patterns
- "Anchors key ideas" over "is central to"
- "Other notes reach for it" over "other notes link to it"
- "Sign" over "indication"

## Note Evolution

### Status progression
1. **Draft** - Raw voice dump, unprocessed
2. **Working** - Being refined, not public yet
3. **Live** - Public, but still evolving
4. **Evergreen** - Stable, high-quality

### How notes evolve
- Start as raw voice dumps (30-60 min walks)
- Agent helps discern: public vs private
- Extract 3-5 new note ideas from each note
- Condense original, link out to new notes
- Revise for voice, clarity, connections

## Connection Patterns

### When to link
- **Always**: When you reference another concept
- **Proper nouns**: `[[Awake Happy]]` not "Awake Happy"
- **Claims**: `[[Box-first earns trust]]` links to the full argument
- **Concepts**: `[[Deep work]]` links to what it means to Devon

### Dense linking
- More links = better knowledge graph
- Each note should have 5-10 outbound links
- Backlinks show centrality (hence the ⭐ star system)

## Tags & Metadata

### Visibility
- `public` - Anyone can see
- `private` - Devon only
- `working` - In progress, not ready

### Status
- `draft` - Raw capture
- `working` - Being refined
- `live` - Public
- `evergreen` - Stable

### Tags
- Keep minimal (3-5 max)
- Use for broad themes: `writing`, `thinking`, `business`, `tech`
- Don't duplicate WikiLinks as tags

## The Agent's Role

### Agent asks questions
- Helps make connections: "Do you think these are connected?"
- Spots old notes: "You might think differently now?"
- Adds context: "Tell me more about Matt"
- Synthesizes: "Here are 5 new notes from that walk"

### Boundaries
- Agent learns what's public vs private
- Remembers people: Matt (collaborator), Joel (growth), family
- Knows projects: Commune, Ads Lab, Awake Happy
- Respects: "Voice in, approvals out" - nothing public without approval

## Depth Gating (Future)

### What gets gated
- AI summaries of commit history
- RAG search across all notes
- Evolution story of a note over time
- Voice clips in tooltips
- "Ask My Brain" Q&A feature

### Why gate
- Computation costs money
- Super users want unlimited, so they buy the box
- Free tier gets you in, paid tier unblocks
- Box = self-host, own data, use Ollama

## The Vision

This wiki is:
- **A thinking system** that compounds over time
- **Devon's life** - 15 years of business, film, e-commerce, ads, now Commune
- **A product** - Shows what Commune can do
- **A living document** - Notes improve through revision
- **Not a blog** - Notes, not posts. Evergreen, not chronological.

The goal: Build a system so good at understanding Devon that it can help others discover themselves and make a living doing it.

## Quality Signals Research (Oct 16, 2025)

Based on analysis of Andy Matuschak, Maggie Appleton, Gwern, and 7+ other digital gardens:

### Key Finding: Signal Context, Not Quality

**Don't try to measure note quality algorithmically.** Instead, provide context so readers can judge for themselves.

### What Actually Indicates Quality

1. **Atomicity** - One concept, fully developed (often 200-500 words!)
2. **Conceptual clarity** - Complete-phrase titles that make claims
3. **Own-voice processing** - Your words, not copy-paste
4. **Linking density** - Connected to the knowledge graph

### What DOESN'T Indicate Quality

1. **Word count** - Short atomic notes are often the BEST notes
2. **Backlink count** - High backlinks are EFFECT not CAUSE of quality
3. **Composite metrics** - Word count + backlinks = misleading

### Growth Stages (Future)

Consider implementing 3-stage development markers:
- 🌱 **Seedling** - Raw idea, still developing
- 🌿 **Budding** - Maturing, growing connections
- 🌳 **Evergreen** - Stable, polished

**Philosophy**: Growth mindset over static ratings. Even "evergreen" notes keep evolving.

### Andy Matuschak's Approach

He uses NO explicit quality indicators. Just timestamps and backlinks. Trusts the graph.

His most valuable notes have:
- Hub pattern (20-30+ backlinks)
- Clear thesis statements upfront
- Self-exemplifying (note demonstrates the concept)
- Dense internal linking (10-15+ links)
- Complete-phrase titles

**His metric**: "Number of evergreen notes written per day" - with caveat that thinking matters more than note-taking.

### For Commune

- Keep backlink counts ("3 links to this note")
- Keep stars for top 5% (organic discovery, not quality judgment)
- Avoid status badges (too performative)
- Trust Devon to know quality better than any algorithm
- Future: Consider growth stage indicators (seedling/budding/evergreen)

**Core principle**: Better thinking > better note-taking

## Meta

This Bible itself should evolve. When we find new patterns or anti-patterns, add them here. When Devon's voice shifts, update the examples. This is the source of truth for note-writing decisions.
