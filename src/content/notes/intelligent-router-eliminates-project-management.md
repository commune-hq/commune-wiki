Full project management is a joke. The premise is broken. PM tools exist because you need oversight, but if you capture everything (meetings, transcripts, the work you did) and the router updates the knowledge base, you don't need the oversight tool. The team just queries the KB. "What did Issa do yesterday?" If everyone uses the router, we're good.

The traditional PM workflow:
1. Do work
2. Report on work
3. Manage reports about work
4. Have meetings about the reports

The router workflow:
1. Do work (captured automatically)
2. Query the system when you need context

This is fundamentally about [[Business management is fundamentally the management of expanding context]]. Instead of creating artificial overhead to track context, you capture it naturally and make it queryable.

The key challenge becomes [[The router's primary challenge is updating knowledge bases tastefully and non-destructively]]. It's not enough to just dump informationâ€”the system needs to integrate new context without degrading existing knowledge.

This connects to why [[Manual file management is a high-friction waste of cognitive resources]]. The same principle applies: automate the organization so humans can focus on the actual work.
