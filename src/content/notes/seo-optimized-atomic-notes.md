summary: Atomic notes formatted as articles create more entry points for search and LLM discovery. More potential hits than traditional blog posts.
---

Traditional blogs publish one post at a time. Maybe 2-3 per week. Limited entry points for search engines.

[[Atomic Notes]] create way more surface area. Every note is an article. If you publish 50 atomic notes on related topics, that's 50 potential entry points for Google and LLMs.

More entry points means more chances to rank for niche queries. Someone searching for a specific concept finds your note on that exact concept. Not a 3000-word blog post where their question is buried halfway down.

This works even better with LLMs. When ChatGPT or Perplexity crawls for sources, [[Atomic Notes]] with clear claims are better retrieval targets than rambling blog posts.

For [[Commune]], this means the voice-first workflow actually creates better SEO than manual blogging. [[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]] turns your thinking into dozens of focused articles automatically.

Combined with [[Auto-generated OG images for notes]], every note gets optimized for rich results without manual work.

This is part of the "dump thoughts, make money automatically" vision. SEO happens as a side effect of thinking out loud.
