summary: "A platform for sharing your thinking in public without algorithmic feeds. Voice capture flows into atomic notes, readers navigate via explicit links, and depth-gating protects attention."
---

I'm building [[Commune]] to make a living by finding yourself through working notes in public. No feeds. No algorithms. Just your thinking in the open.

The goal is simple. Talk into your phone and thought dump. AI drafts atomic notes ([[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]]) and helps you connect things. You use subscriptions and discovery features to grow a following interested in the way you think. Published notes become [[Evergreen Notes]] you can navigate, not posts fighting for attention.

Discovery runs on time and explicit links. [[See what I'm working on]] shows what changed. [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] means every connection has a reason. No recommendations. No virality metrics.

You can read notes for free, but deeper exploration requires a subscription ([[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]]).

I run [[The Commune box]] at home. It's optional. You control what publishes. The platform doesn't own your notes. You can self-host like I do, or use our cloud if you prefer.

Share the messy process, not just polished outputs. [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]] turns fragmented notes into coherent thought every week.

This site runs an early version of commune displaying [[My Working Notes]].
