summary: "A platform for sharing your thinking in public without algorithmic feeds. Voice capture flows into atomic notes, readers navigate via explicit links, and depth-gating protects attention."
---

[[Commune]] is a platform for making a living by finding yourself through the process of working notes in public. No feeds. No algorithms. Just your thinking in the open.

I walk and talk. AI drafts atomic notes ([[Automated note shaping from voice]]). Published notes become [[Atomic Notes]] you can navigate, not posts fighting for attention.

Discovery runs on time and explicit links. [[Ledger replaces feeds]] shows what changed. [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] means every connection has a reason. No recommendations. No virality metrics.

[[Three panes deep, then you pay]] keeps three clicks from the homepage free. Deeper exploration needs a subscription ([[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]]). Readers get [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]], [[Ask the Brain]], and [[Suggestions and Proposals make readers part of the work]].

[[The Commune box]] runs at home. You control what publishes. The platform doesn't own your notes.

[[Zen practice protects attention]] meets transparency. Share the messy process, not just polished outputs. [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]] turns fragmented notes into coherent thought every week.

This site runs an early version. I'm building it in public. Follow the [[Ledger replaces feeds]] to see what changes.
