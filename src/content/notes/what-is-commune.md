summary: "A platform for sharing your thinking in public without algorithmic feeds. Voice capture flows into atomic notes, readers navigate via explicit links, and depth-gating protects attention."
---

Commune is a platform for working in public without the chaos of social feeds. Instead of optimizing for engagement, it protects attention while making thinking transparent.

The core loop: capture thoughts by voice while walking, an agent drafts atomic notes, you approve or toss. See [[Voice in, approvals out]]. Published notes become [[Atomic Notes]] in a navigable knowledge graph, not chronological posts competing for attention.

Discovery happens through explicit mechanisms, not algorithms. The [[Ledger replaces feeds]] shows recent changes across the graph. [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] means every connection has a clear reason—no recommendation engines, no virality metrics.

[[Depth-3 free is honest gating]] keeps three hops from the homepage open while protecting deeper exploration behind paid access. This creates calm surfaces for depth work. Readers get agency through [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]], [[Ask the Brain]], and [[Suggestions and Proposals make readers part of the work]].

Everything private runs on [[The Commune box]]—your own hardware at home. You control what publishes. The platform doesn't own your knowledge graph.

This combines [[Zen practice protects attention]] with transparency. Share the messy process of thinking, not just polished outputs. Weekly synthesis happens via [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]], turning fragmented notes into coherent thought.

Commune is in active development. This site runs an early version. If you're building something similar, explore the linked notes. To stay updated, follow via the ledger.
