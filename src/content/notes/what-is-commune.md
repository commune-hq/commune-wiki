Commune is a platform for working in public without the noise. It's designed for people who want to share their thinking while respecting both their attention and their readers'.

## How It Works

### Capture: Voice In, Approvals Out
You capture thoughts by voice while walking or thinking. An agent processes them into draft notes. You approve or toss. The work happens in the gaps between thinking and publishing. See [[Voice in, approvals out]].

### Discovery: No Feed, Just Signal
There's no algorithmic feed. Discovery happens through:
- **Time**: Browse the [[Ledger replaces feeds]] to see what changed recently
- **Follows**: Follow people or topics that matter to you
- **Explicit Links**: Every connection has a clear reason

See [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]].

### Exploration: Depth-Gated Access
Three hops from the homepage are open to everyone. Deeper branches lock behind paid access. This keeps the public surface navigable while protecting the full knowledge graph. See [[Depth-3 free is honest gating]].

Serendipity comes from [[Related and Stroll give serendipity without a feed]]—connections based on content, not engagement metrics.

### Reader Agency
Readers aren't passive consumers:
- **Follow & Collect**: Build your own trail through the content. See [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]].
- **Ask the Brain**: Query the knowledge graph and get answers with receipts. See [[Ask the Brain]].
- **Suggest Edits**: Spot an error or edge case? Leave a suggestion. Updates appear in the ledger. See [[Suggestions and Proposals make readers part of the work]].

### Privacy & Control
Everything private runs on your own box at home. You only publish what you approve. The platform doesn't own your data—you do. See [[Box-first earns trust]].

## Philosophy

Commune is built on a few core principles:
- **Attention is Sacred**: No viral loops, no engagement optimization. See [[Zen practice protects attention]].
- **Working in Public**: Share the messy process, not just polished outputs.
- **Agency Over Algorithms**: Readers choose their path; algorithms don't choose for them.
- **Calm Surfaces**: Paid access creates space for depth without pressure to perform.

Weekly wraps close the loop, synthesizing the week's thinking into coherent essays. See [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]].

## Status

Commune is in active development. This site is running on an early version of the platform. Features are being built and documented in public as the system evolves.
