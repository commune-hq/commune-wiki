summary: "Once a month, review everything you captured. Write a human synthesis. What mattered? What connected? What changed your thinking?"

Daily notes capture everything. Weekly summaries organize the week. Monthly Release wraps the whole month in human reflection.

Not AI-generated. Not automated summarization. You sit down and think: what actually mattered this month? What connections emerged? What changed?

The format is flexible. Could be an essay. Could be a curated list of the month's best notes. Could be a reflection on themes that showed up repeatedly. Point is: human synthesis, not machine aggregation.

This connects to [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]]. Similar idea, different timescale. Weekly wraps close tight loops. Monthly releases zoom out further.

The benefit: forces periodic reflection. Without it, you capture constantly but never synthesize. The notes accumulate but don't compound. Release creates compounding by making connections explicit.

For readers following your work, Release answers "what happened this month?" Better than reading the raw ledger. Better than skimming individual notes. It's the curated tour.

This enables [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]]. Followers get monthly synthesis without noise. They see your thinking evolve at a pace that respects their attention.

Implementation: last day of each month, review the month's notes. Write 500-1000 words. What connected? What surprised you? What matters going forward? Publish as a note. Link from the ledger.

The practice builds [[Externalizing thought builds a cognitive scaffold for solving complex problems]]. Monthly review reveals patterns invisible in daily work.
