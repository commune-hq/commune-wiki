Follow is for updates. Collect is for taste. That is enough social. When you Collect a note, it shows on your profile. People can browse your library, follow you, and walk your trail. Co-collection is a strong signal for [[Related and Stroll give serendipity without a feed]].

This stays human. No likes. No karma. No hidden rank. Updates live in the [[Ledger replaces feeds]] and in monthly [[Release is a monthly human wrap]]. Collect also helps creators. If two notes are often collected together but never linked, I add a line to connect them.

If a note gets collected a lot but confuses people, I tighten the title through [[Titles are takeaways, not labels]]. Social does not need to be loud to be useful. Taste, trails, and time are enough. This approach supports [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] by keeping social signals clear and intentional.

The system enables [[People pay to follow a working mind]] because followers can see both the work and the curation that shapes it. It connects to [[Zen practice protects attention]] by avoiding the dopamine loops of engagement-driven social features.

Collect creates natural pathways through [[Personal Knowledge Graphs]] based on human judgment rather than algorithmic recommendation. This supports [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] by letting readers create their own conceptual trails through the knowledge base.
