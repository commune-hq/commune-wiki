[[Commune]] has two social features: Follow and Collect. Follow is for updates. Collect is for taste. That's enough social.

When you collect a note, it shows on your profile. People can browse your library, follow you, walk your trail. Co-collection becomes a strong signal for [[Related and Stroll give serendipity without a feed]]. If two people collect the same pair of notes, that connection matters.

No likes. No karma. No hidden ranking algorithms. Updates live in [[See what I'm working on]]. If two notes get collected together frequently but I've never linked them, that's a signal I should add a connection.

If a note gets collected a lot but confuses people, I tighten the title ([[Titles are takeaways, not labels]]). Social doesn't need to be loud to be useful. Taste, trails, and time are enough.

[[I hope people will pay for a working mind]] when followers see both the work and the curation that shapes it. Collect creates natural pathways through wikis based on human judgment, not algorithmic recommendation. [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] works when readers can create their own conceptual trails through the knowledge base.
