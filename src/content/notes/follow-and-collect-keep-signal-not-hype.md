Follow is for updates. Collect is for taste. That is enough social. Collect a note, it shows on your profile. People can browse your library, follow you, and walk your trail. Co-collection is a strong signal for [[Related and Stroll give serendipity without a feed]].

Stays human. No likes. No karma. No hidden rank. Updates live in the [[Ledger replaces feeds]] and in monthly [[Release is a monthly human wrap]]. Collect helps creators. If two notes are often collected together but never linked, I add a line to connect them.

If a note gets collected a lot but confuses people, I tighten the title ([[Titles are takeaways, not labels]]). Social does not need to be loud to be useful. Taste, trails, and time are enough. [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] by keeping social signals clear and intentional.

[[I hope people will pay for a working mind]] because followers see both the work and the curation that shapes it. [[Zen practice protects attention]] by avoiding the dopamine loops of engagement-driven social features.

Collect creates natural pathways through wikis based on human judgment rather than algorithmic recommendation. [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] by letting readers create their own conceptual trails through the knowledge base.
