Pacing and breath clear the stack. A slow walk before capture improves the notes. Less noise in. More signal out. This is another reason to hold the line on [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]]. Infinite feeds burn attention and train you to chase reactions.

A quiet [[Ledger replaces feeds]] and a calm map ask for intent. When I keep the day simple, [[Voice in, approvals out]] works better. The agent hears a clean claim and proposes a clean note. [[Ask the Brain]] returns cleaner answers because the notes are not padded.

Zen is not branding here. It is the method for making a public brain that stays sane. The [[Box-first earns trust]] gives me a private place to practice. The Notebook lets me share the parts that help others think.

This practice supports [[Defaulting to No protects deep work]] by creating space between stimulus and response. It enables [[Externalizing thought builds cognitive scaffold]] because a calm mind can better distinguish between thoughts worth capturing and mental noise.

The combination of contemplative practice and [[Local-First Software]] creates a sustainable approach to [[Build in Public]] without burning out from constant performance pressure.
