The simple view of [[Commune]] is free. You get a tease of what it is and it looks great, but anything that gives you depth into the mind is subscription based. Like [[Substack]]. You can read the first half, subscribe to get the rest.

Free tier gives you three pane levels deep ([[Three panes deep, then you pay]]). You land on the home note ([[The home note triages to your best ideas]]). Click through two more levels, then hit a wall. [[The Star]] notes guide you to the core ideas. But if you want to go deeper into the full mind, you have to pay.

[[Three panes deep, then you pay]] gets more interesting when AI layers on top. Followers want to search across all your notes. That costs money. AI can analyze how a note has changed over time, look at every edit, and write the story of all those changes. That costs money too.

I'm still figuring out pricing... I might do $2 to unlock the full brain, $5 for semantic search and commenting, and maybe $10 for deep research and some final level of depth I have yet to determine. Not sure if everyone should have the same tiers or if it should be different.

Learning more about this process and building out the brain will likely lead people to wanting the [[Commune]] box. [[The Commune box]] explains the privacy angle. Self-host it, bring your own keys, hook up your own model. Choose something like Ollama to get away from cloud providers. Store all your notes locally. As your mind gets bigger, you use more AI bandwidth to expand it. Creators hit a point where the box is cheaper than cloud credits.

Makes [[Build in Public]] work because people see the value before paying. The mechanics reveal themselves ([[Gamification drives self-discovery]]).
