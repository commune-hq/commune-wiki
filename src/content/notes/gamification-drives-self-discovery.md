I want to use gamification to help people discover themselves and make a living doing that. That's my dream. That's what [[Commune]] is really about.

Not fake internet points. Real mechanics that surface what I actually care about. [[The Star]] does this. It shows which ideas carry weight in my thinking. [[Skool]] does this with contributor badges. Both reveal patterns I'd miss otherwise.

The trick is making the game about something real. My wiki shows how my ideas connect. Backlinks reveal centrality. Revision history shows evolution. These aren't arbitrary metrics. They're my thinking made visible.

When I see which notes anchor my wiki, I learn what I actually care about. When I track how notes evolve, I see how my thinking changes. That's self-discovery through the system itself, not despite it.

The "make a living" part comes later. Once I've built a wiki worth following, [[I hope people will pay for a working mind]]. [[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]] lets me charge for access to deeper insights. [[Build in Public]] shows progress and earns trust.

Fifteen years of business evolution taught me what works. Lost it all in the Google Panda update. Burned out selling products I didn't care about. Finally found my way to [[Commune]], which syndicates everything I've learned.

The vision is a system so good at helping people discover themselves that others pay to see how they think. Game mechanics that reveal truth, not distraction.
