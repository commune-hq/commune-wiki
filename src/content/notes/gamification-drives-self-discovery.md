I want to use gamification to help people discover themselves and make a living doing that. That's my dream. That's what [[Commune]] is really about.

Not fake internet points. Real mechanics that surface what you actually care about. [[The Star]] does this—it shows which ideas carry weight in your thinking. [[Skool]] does this with contributor badges. Both reveal patterns you'd miss otherwise.

The trick is making the game about something real. Your wiki shows how your ideas connect. Backlinks reveal centrality. Revision history shows evolution. These aren't arbitrary metrics—they're your thinking made visible.

When you see which notes anchor your wiki, you learn what you actually care about. When you track how notes evolve, you see how your thinking changes. That's self-discovery through the system itself, not despite it.

The "make a living" part comes later. Once you've built a wiki worth following, [[I hope people will pay for a working mind]]. [[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]] lets you charge for access to deeper insights. [[Build in Public]] shows progress and earns trust.

Fifteen years of business evolution taught me what works. Lost it all in the Google Panda update. Burned out selling products I didn't care about. Finally found my way to [[Commune]], which syndicates everything I've learned.

The vision: a system so good at helping you discover yourself that others pay to see how you think. Game mechanics that reveal truth, not distraction.
