summary: "Dump thoughts while walking. AI shapes them into atomic notes. Review in iOS app. Refine with more voice. Infinite game of hammering notes into 150-250 word format."

[[Manual note refinement doesn't scale]]. I used Reflect for years, manually copying and pasting. That's why I'm building this.

I dump thoughts while walking. The vision is AI that understands how I write shapes them into [[Atomic Notes]]. 150 to 250 words, single concept, densely linked.

System sends drafts back to my iOS app. I review. Reply with more voice to refine. Wrong angle? Say so. Missing link? Add it. Draft sounds robotic? Reject and rephrase.

Infinite loop. Dump thoughts → AI drafts → review → refine → repeat. Hammer notes into atomic format over time.

Still building the agent and algorithm. Current state: I talk, AI drafts, I manually refine. The vision is I approve or toss. Future state: AI learns my voice patterns, link preferences, and atomic note structure. Gets better with every cycle.

[[The Commune box]] keeps capture private ([[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]]). No tags to babysit. No manual graph gardening. [[Manual file management is a high-friction waste of cognitive resources]]. Voice capture eliminates that.

If the draft sounds like me, it ships. If it sounds like a bot, it waits. Voice stays intact. Pace stays high.

Clear notes feed [[Ask the Brain]]. Real edits feed [[See what I'm working on]]. [[Notes beat posts for showing progress]] because you capture atomic thoughts immediately.
