A title should read like a conclusion. Labels slow readers and weaken [[Ask the Brain]]. A sharp title makes a short note land. It also makes links work better because the title itself is a handle.

"[[Box-first earns trust]]" is stronger than "Self-hosting." "[[Ledger replaces feeds]]" is stronger than "Changelog." Writing the claim in the title forces clarity in the body. If I cannot name the claim, I split the note or I need to think more.

Good titles let the agent draft better suggestions in [[Voice in, approvals out]]. Good titles make the [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]] outline easier to write. Titles are small, but they decide whether the whole system stays learnable.

This connects to [[Evergreen Notes]] principles because atomic notes need atomic titles. It supports [[Notes beat posts for showing progress]] because clear titles make individual notes more discoverable and linkable. The approach enables [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] because descriptive titles create natural connection points.

Strong titles also improve [[People pay to follow a working mind]] because readers can quickly scan the [[Ledger replaces feeds]] and understand what changed without opening every note.
