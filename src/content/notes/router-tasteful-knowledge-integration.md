The router just needs to be the best at routing. The challenge isn't just taking information and routing it; it's updating the destination files in a way that is *tasteful* and doesn't degrade the existing knowledge. That tasteful integration might even be personal, so we need to build for that understanding.

This is the core technical challenge of Commune. Anyone can dump information into files. The sophistication is in the integration—understanding context, maintaining quality, preserving voice and style.

Key requirements:
- **Non-destructive updates**: Never lose existing knowledge
- **Style preservation**: Maintain the voice and structure of existing notes
- **Context awareness**: Understand what information belongs where
- **Personal taste**: Adapt to individual preferences and patterns

This connects to why [[Local systems require "Enhancement Dashboards" for user-in-the-loop model training]]. The system needs to learn your specific preferences for how information should be integrated.

The payoff is [[A sufficiently intelligent router eliminates the need for traditional project management]]. When the router can tastefully maintain context, you don't need artificial PM overhead.

This is fundamentally different from traditional knowledge management systems that treat all information as equivalent. The router needs to understand nuance, quality, and relationship between ideas—not just storage and retrieval.
