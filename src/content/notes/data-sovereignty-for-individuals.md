Data sovereignty means you control your data completely. Not "privacy settings" on someone else's platform. Complete ownership, like a nation controls its borders.

The current model: platforms own your content, relationships, and behavior data. You get free access. They monetize everything. You can't export the full context. You can't move to competitors without starting over.

The alternative: your data lives on your infrastructure. You control access. You decide what publishes. Platforms that want to display your content pull from your server, not their database.

This is [[Local-First Software]] plus [[The Commune box]]. Your hardware, your rules. No platform can delete your account or change terms unilaterally.

The practical benefits:
- Complete export capability (not just "download your data")
- No platform lock-in
- Privacy by default, publication by choice
- Your data improves your tools, not platform tools

This enables [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]]. When you own all the data, your AI can access everything for context. Cloud AI only sees fragments.

This connects to [[Owning your data infrastructure eliminates the need for specialized middleware and roles]]. Control the full stack and you eliminate dependencies on platforms that extract value from your information.

The philosophical shift: from tenant to owner. From user to sovereign. Your digital presence should be property you control, not sharecropped land on someone else's platform.

[[Commune]] implements this. Your notes live on your server. The public surface pulls from your source. You control everything.
