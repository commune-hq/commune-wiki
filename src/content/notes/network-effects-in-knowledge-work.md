summary: "Knowledge compounds nonlinearly. Each new note connects to existing notes. Value increases faster than linear growth."

Network effects mean value grows faster than linear addition. One new note might connect to five existing notes, creating five new pathways for thought. The next note creates even more connections.

Traditional knowledge work treats information as accumulation. More facts, more insights, more documents. Linear growth. Linked notes create multiplicative value. Each addition makes the existing system more useful.

[[Associative linking over hierarchies]] matters because hierarchies force single-parent relationships. Networks allow many-to-many connections. The same note can participate in multiple contexts simultaneously.

The compounding happens through unexpected connections. You write a note about business management. It links to notes about AI, notes about attention, notes about infrastructure. Suddenly you see patterns invisible in isolation.

[[Andy Matuschaks Notes]] demonstrate this. His system has thousands of notes. New notes reference old notes, creating surprising connections years apart. The value isn't in individual notes. It's in the web.

When everything connects, you see what others miss. [[Integrated data analysis unlocks observations impossible in siloed systems]]. Siloed information has linear value. Networked information has exponential value.

Invest in infrastructure for connection, not just capture. Make linking easy. Surface related notes automatically. Prioritize integration over organization.

[[The Star]] measures this. Notes with many inbound links anchor the network. They're connection points that make everything else more valuable.
