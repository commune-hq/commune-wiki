summary: Desktop has preview panes on hover. Mobile needs something equivalent that lets you peek at the next page without breaking flow.
---

The desktop experience has preview panes. Hover over a link, see a preview of what's on that page. You can read ahead without clicking. Keeps flow unbroken.

Mobile doesn't have hover. When you tap a link, you navigate away. Flow breaks. You can't peek ahead.

What's the mobile equivalent? I don't know yet. Needs research.

Maybe a slide-down preview card? Tap and hold to preview? Some kind of gesture that doesn't conflict with browser swipes?

Need to study [[Skool]], Linktree, other apps with interesting mobile patterns. Find something that matches the desktop preview value.

The core principle is [[Preview panes preserve reading flow]]. Don't make people click blind. Let them see what's next before committing to the navigation.

This is critical for [[Commune]] because the depth gating model depends on people exploring notes. If mobile feels clunky, half your users bounce.
