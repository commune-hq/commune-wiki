I'm Devon Meadows. Dad. Thinker. Tinkerer. I'm building [[Commune]] (that's what's powering this site). I also run [[Ads Lab]] and [[Awake Happy]]. This is my working brain in public.

I realized I walk and talk into my phone and a lot of things get lost in translation. For a long time, I've been trying to figure out how to convert gigantic chunks of my raw transcripts into some kind of useful format. That's what I'm currently building. As my vision evolves, I'm adding it along the way. AI turns voice into drafts ([[Automated note shaping from voice]]). I see what changed in the [[Ledger replaces feeds]]. Three clicks from here are open. Deeper branches lock ([[Three panes deep, then you pay]]).

Ask questions and get answers with receipts ([[Ask the Brain]]). See a fix? Leave a suggestion. I review it and the [[Ledger replaces feeds]] shows the change ([[Suggestions and Proposals make readers part of the work]]).

Everything runs on my home server. Hosting, data, app, all of it ([[The Commune box]]).

The sliding panes owe a debt to [[Andy Matuschak's Notes]]. His work showed how interface shapes thinking.
