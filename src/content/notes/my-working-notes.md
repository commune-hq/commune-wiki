I'm Devon Meadows. Dad. Thinker. Tinkerer. I'm building [[Commune]] (that's what's powering this site). I also run [[Ads Lab]] and [[Awake Happy]]. This is my working brain in public.

I walk and talk into my phone a lot. Good ideas come out, but they get buried in messy transcripts. For a long time, I've been trying to figure out how to convert those raw voice dumps into something useful.

I finally realized [[Manual note refinement doesnt scale]]. That's why I'm building [[Commune]]. These working notes reflect my evolving vision to automatically convert my raw thoughts into [[Evergreen Notes]] in a public wiki while also logging my daily notes in full to [[The Commune box]] at home so I can run automations and agentic workflows on top of them. No sending sensitive data to cloud providers. Everything runs there. Hosting, data, app, all of it.

The sliding panes owe a debt to [[Andy Matuschaks Notes]]. His work showed how interface shapes thinking.
