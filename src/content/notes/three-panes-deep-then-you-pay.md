summary: Commune lets creators gate their wiki at any depth. Three panes is the default. Land on home, click twice more, hit a wall.

[[Commune]] lets you gate your wiki at any depth. I'm using three panes as my default. You land on the home page, click through two more levels, then hit a wall.

The wall shows you what's locked before you click. No surprise paywalls after you've invested attention.

Haven't decided if the gate is email unlock or payment yet. [[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]] explores pricing tiers. Different subscription levels could unlock different depths.

Three levels is enough to know if the wiki is worth following. Too shallow and people bounce. Too deep and nobody pays.

Helps me design better too. I can choose which branches stay public. Pin important stuff close to the home page. Let the deeper explorations live behind the gate.

Clear walls beat cheap tricks. [[I hope people will pay for a working mind]] when the value is obvious upfront.
