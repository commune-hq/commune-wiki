Managing a business is really just managing a shit ton of context that is continuously expanding. This system scales because it handles that expansion automatically. Your marketing campaigns are better if you have a gigantic, accessible style guide from all prior successes. The router allows you to manage way more stuff because it manages the context.

Traditional business tools try to solve this by creating more containers: project folders, departmental silos, quarterly reports. But containers don't scale—they fragment context and create information islands.

The breakthrough insight: [[A sufficiently intelligent router eliminates the need for traditional project management]]. Instead of managing context through artificial structures, you capture it naturally and make it intelligently accessible.

This enables [[Integrated data analysis unlocks observations impossible in siloed systems]]. When all your context is connected—Shopify, ads, customer support, personal insights—you can see patterns that are invisible in traditional business tools.

The competitive advantage isn't just efficiency—it's intelligence. Businesses that can synthesize all their context will make better decisions than businesses stuck in departmental silos.

This is why [[Owning your data infrastructure eliminates the need for specialized middleware and roles]]. When you control the full context stack, you can optimize for insight rather than compatibility.
