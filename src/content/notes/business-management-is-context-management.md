Managing a business is really just managing a shit ton of context that is continuously expanding. This creates the same problem as [[Manual file management is high-friction waste]]—but at business scale. Your marketing campaigns are better if you have a gigantic, accessible style guide from all prior successes. The [[Intelligent router eliminates project management]] allows you to manage way more stuff because it manages the context automatically.

Traditional business tools try to solve this by creating more containers: project folders, departmental silos, quarterly reports. But containers don't scale—they fragment context and create information islands. This is why [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] matters for business systems, not just personal notes.
