People call these "digital gardens," but I think of this as my Public Workbench. It's a practice. Putting it out there and seeing it helps you think and get better at solving the problems you're trying to solve in life. It's the feedback loop of externalizing and structuring thought.

The magic isn't in the storageâ€”it's in the act of articulation. When you force yourself to write down what you're thinking, you discover gaps in your logic, connections you hadn't seen, and clarity you didn't know you were missing.

This connects to why [[Manual file management is a high-friction waste of cognitive resources]]. The cognitive load should be on the thinking, not the organizing. The workbench handles the structure so your brain can focus on the connections.

It's also why [[Unscheduled "quick calls" destroy deep work flow states]]. These external interruptions break the delicate process of building and maintaining your cognitive scaffold.

The compound effect is real: each note becomes a building block for future insights. The more you externalize, the more sophisticated your internal thinking becomes.
