Andy Matuschak's public note system at [notes.andymatuschak.org](https://notes.andymatuschak.org) demonstrates how digital note-taking can support serious intellectual work.

Key innovations:
- **[[Evergreen Notes]]** that are atomic, concept-oriented, and densely linked
- **Sliding pane interface** that allows multiple notes to be viewed simultaneously
- **Public by default** approach that builds knowledge in the open

His core insight: most note-taking systems optimize for capture, not for developing ideas over time. [[Evergreen Notes]] are designed to compound and evolve, creating a **thinking environment** rather than just an archive.

The sliding panes interface solves a fundamental problem with hyperlinked notes: context loss. When you click a link, you lose the original context. Sliding panes preserve the path of exploration, making it easier to see connections between ideas.

This system influenced the design of [[Commune]] and many other digital garden implementations. The key principles translate beyond note-taking to any system designed for knowledge work.

**Critical insight**: The interface shapes the thinking. Linear documents encourage linear thinking. Networked interfaces encourage associative thinking.
