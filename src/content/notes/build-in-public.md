summary: "Share your work as you build it. Show the mess, the decisions, the failures. Don't wait for polish."

I'm building [[Commune]] in public. That means you see the work as it happens. Not polished announcements. The actual process.

I share decisions as I make them. Failed experiments. Work-in-progress screenshots. What's broken. What's working. The constraints I'm dealing with.

Most people wait until something's done to show it. That's backwards. Sharing incomplete work gets better feedback. People can see where you're headed and suggest course corrections before you waste time.

The architecture decisions become [[Evergreen Notes]] you can read. The implementation progress is documented in real-time through [[See what I'm working on]]. The entire knowledge base is the case study.

Building in public creates accountability. If I say I'm working on something, I better ship it. It attracts people who care about the same problems. [[Transparent decision-making builds trust]] faster than marketing copy.

The trap is optimizing for audience instead of solving real problems. I avoid that by building for myself first, documenting for others second. If it works for me, the documentation helps others. If it doesn't work, the documentation shows why.

[[Learning in public accelerates growth]] because teaching forces clarity.
