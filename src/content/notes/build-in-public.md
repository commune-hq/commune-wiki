summary: "Building in public means sharing your work, decisions, and learning process openly, creating accountability and community around your projects."

Building in public means documenting your work as you do it, sharing both successes and failures with an audience. This creates accountability, attracts collaborators, and builds trust through transparency.

Benefits:
- **Accountability**: Public commitments create motivation to follow through
- **Feedback loops**: Early input prevents costly mistakes
- **Community building**: Shared journey creates invested followers
- **Learning amplification**: Teaching others deepens your own understanding

The key is sharing **process, not just outcomes**. Instead of announcing finished products, document:
- Decision-making rationale
- Failed experiments and lessons learned
- Work-in-progress screenshots and demos
- Resource constraints and trade-offs

This approach influenced [[Commune]]'s development: architecture decisions become [[Andy Matuschak's Notes]]-style public notes, implementation progress gets documented in real-time, and the entire knowledge base serves as a case study.

**Counter-intuitive insight**: Sharing incomplete work often generates more valuable feedback than polished presentations. People can see where you're heading and suggest course corrections.

The risk is premature optimization for audience rather than solving real problems. The solution: build for yourself first, document for others second.
