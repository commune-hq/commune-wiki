Building a wiki where notes link to each other lets you see patterns you'd miss otherwise. [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] means ideas can connect in ways folders never allow.

The power isn't in storing information—it's in discovering connections. When you write [[Awake Happy]] taught me economics matter, and link it to [[Ads Lab]] bridges what I learned in e-commerce, you start seeing threads across your whole story.

Cross-domain insights happen naturally. A business lesson connects to a personal observation through shared principles. [[Film production taught me context management]] links to [[Business management is context management]] links to [[What is Commune|Commune]]—suddenly fifteen years of experience has a through-line.

This is why [[The Star]] matters. The notes with the most backlinks aren't just popular—they're central to how you think. They anchor everything else.

The system enables questions traditional search can't answer:
- Which ideas influenced how I think about automation?
- Where do my business projects and personal principles overlap?
- What contradictions exist in my thinking?

[[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]] because the agent has access to all these connections. [[Integrated data analysis unlocks impossible observations]] when your Shopify data, ad campaigns, voice notes, and wiki all link together.

The trick is balance. Too much automatic linking creates noise. Too little manual curation misses connections. That's why [[Voice in, approvals out]] works—I capture freely, the agent proposes links, I approve what fits.

The result: [[Externalizing thought builds cognitive scaffold]]. Each note becomes a building block. The more you write, the more sophisticated your thinking becomes.
