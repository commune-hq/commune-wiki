Building a wiki where notes link to each other lets you see patterns you'd miss otherwise. [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] means ideas can connect in ways folders never allow.

The power isn't storing information. It's discovering connections. When you write [[Awake Happy]] taught me economics matter, and link it to [[Ads Lab]] bridges what I learned in e-commerce, you start seeing threads across your whole story.

Cross-domain insights happen naturally. A business lesson connects to a personal observation through shared principles. [[Film production taught me context management]] links to [[Business management is fundamentally the management of expanding context]], which links to [[Commune]]. Suddenly fifteen years of experience has a through-line.

[[The Star]] notes with the most backlinks aren't just popular. They're central to how you think. They anchor everything else.

Traditional search can't answer these questions: Which ideas influenced how I think about automation? Where do my business projects and personal principles overlap? What contradictions exist in my thinking?

[[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]] because the agent has access to all these connections. [[Integrated data analysis unlocks observations impossible in siloed systems]] when your Shopify data, ad campaigns, voice notes, and wiki all link together.

The trick is balance. Too much automatic linking creates noise. Too little manual curation misses connections. [[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]] works because I capture freely, the agent proposes links, I approve what fits.

[[Externalizing thought builds a cognitive scaffold for solving complex problems]]. Each note becomes a building block. The more you write, the more sophisticated your thinking becomes.
