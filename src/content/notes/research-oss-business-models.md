summary: "Research on how companies like Plausible, Ghost, and Obsidian built sustainable open source businesses. Bootstrap model validated: $2-3M with 4-18 people."

Analyzed 6 companies (Plausible, Ghost, Cal.com, Supabase, Obsidian, Gumroad) to understand open source business models that actually work. The goal: validate [[Commune]]'s bootstrap strategy without VC.

## Key Findings

**Plausible** ($3.1M revenue, 4 people): AGPL core + paid cloud hosting. 99.9% of revenue from cloud, 0.1% from self-hosted donations. Proves paid hosting works.

**Obsidian** ($2M revenue, 18 people): Free app + paid sync/publish services. 1,000+ community plugins create ecosystem moat. Most aligned with [[Commune]] vision.

**Pattern**: Give away tools (GitHub stars + trust), sell convenience + privacy (hosting, sync, premium features). Self-hosting is marketing, not monetization.

## What We Researched

40+ web searches across recent founder interviews, blog posts, and revenue disclosures from 2024-2025. Focused on companies that stayed profitable without VC pressure.

## Recommendations

**AGPL prevents forks**: Plausible and Cal.com switched to AGPL v3 in 2024 to stop cloud giants from taking without contributing.

**Paid hosting wins**: Ghost and Plausible both generate 99%+ revenue from managed hosting, not self-hosted users. Cloud is convenience, self-hosted is credibility.

**Bootstrap validated**: $2-3M sustainable with 4-18 people. No need for VC if product solves real problem and distribution is organic (GitHub stars, community).
