Analyzed 6 companies (Plausible, Ghost, Cal.com, Supabase, [[Obsidian]], Gumroad) to validate [[Commune]]'s bootstrap strategy without VC. The pattern is clear: give away tools (GitHub stars + trust), sell convenience + privacy (hosting, sync, premium features).

Plausible ($3.1M revenue, 4 people) runs AGPL core + paid cloud hosting. 99.9% of revenue from cloud, 0.1% from self-hosted donations. This proves paid hosting works - cloud is convenience, self-hosted is credibility.

[[Obsidian]] ($2M revenue, 18 people) offers free app + paid sync/publish services. 1,000+ community plugins create ecosystem moat. Most aligned with [[Commune]] vision. Self-hosting is marketing, not monetization.

The research drew from 40+ web searches across founder interviews, blog posts, revenue disclosures from 2024-2025. Focused on companies that stayed profitable without VC pressure. AGPL prevents forks - Plausible and Cal.com switched to AGPL v3 in 2024 to stop cloud giants from taking without contributing back.

Ghost and Plausible both generate 99%+ revenue from managed hosting, not self-hosted users. Bootstrap validated: $2-3M sustainable with 4-18 people. No need for VC if product solves real problem and distribution is organic through [[Build in Public]] (GitHub stars, community).
