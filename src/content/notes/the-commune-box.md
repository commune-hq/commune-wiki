The vision for [[Commune]] is to fully enable people with a physical box they own at home. Not a product yet - an idea I'm building toward. This is how I run my own instance right now.

You shouldn't need to rely on me or any cloud company to run your wiki, analyze your notes, or make money from your work. As your wiki grows, computation costs grow with it. There's no way to make that affordable for you if I'm doing all the computing. The only sustainable path is you running it at home.

It's just a computer. Maybe a purpose-built device, maybe you repurpose one you already have. Your wiki self-hosted. AI analysis and search running locally through something like Ollama. Agent flows you can see and manage. Your database, your state, your data. All yours.

No constant pinging to Apple servers. No constant pinging to OpenAI. Updates get pushed to your box. You stay in control.

The way in is simple SaaS. Get in the door, build your wiki, learn the system, join the community of wikis, become discoverable. But as your wiki grows, computation costs increase. Eventually the box becomes more economical. And more private. And more yours.

The goal isn't to manage a community or write email campaigns or figure out subscriptions. The goal is to help you push your ideas forward independently and maybe make a living from that alone.

[[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]] works because capture happens locally. [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]] because all context stays on the box. No cloud provider sees private notes. No data mining. No optimization for engagement. [[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]] is how readers pay for depth. [[Local-First Software]] is how you keep ownership.
