[[Commune]] runs at home. Everything happens on the box first. Voice capture, drafts, clustering, AI analysis over private notes. I only push what I approve to the public wiki.

That split matters. I can pace and talk without worrying about leaks. Family docs, business notes, wiki content—all in one place. The box is the source of truth.

Readers see what I choose to share. They get the public notes, [[Ledger replaces feeds]], [[Ask the Brain]] over public content. If I want to move to hosted later, I can. But the box stays mine.

[[Voice in, approvals out]] works because capture happens locally. [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]] because all context stays on the box. No cloud provider sees private notes. No data mining. No optimization for engagement.

[[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]] explains the monetization. Self-hosting makes [[Local-First Software]] practical. Ownership first, sharing second. [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] explains why that order matters.

As your wiki grows, the box saves money. Bring your own keys, choose your own model. Something like Ollama gets you away from cloud providers completely. Store everything locally.
