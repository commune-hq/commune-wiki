"Quick calls" are productivity killers disguised as efficiency. A 5-minute interruption can cost 20+ minutes of recovery time to return to deep focus.

The hidden cost isn't the call durationâ€”it's the **context switching penalty**. Deep work requires loading complex mental models into working memory. Interruptions force you to:
1. Save current mental state
2. Load new context for the call
3. Process the conversation
4. Reload original context
5. Rebuild momentum

Research shows it takes 15-25 minutes to fully return to the original task's cognitive depth. A "quick" call becomes a 30-minute productivity loss.

The solution is [[Defaulting to No protects deep work]] through communication boundaries:
- **Scheduled office hours** for non-urgent discussions
- **Async-first communication** via messages or voice notes
- **Clear urgency definitions** (true emergencies only)

This connects to [[Manual file management is a high-friction waste of cognitive resources]] because both represent cognitive overhead that should be eliminated through better systems.

**Counter-intuitive insight**: Saying no to quick calls makes you more available for meaningful collaboration because you can engage fully when scheduled.

**Related**: [[Externalizing thought builds cognitive scaffold]], [[Business management is context management]]
