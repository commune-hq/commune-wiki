<a href="https://skool.com/adslab?utm_source=devonmeadows&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="white-space:nowrap">Ads Lab<span class="external-link-icon" aria-hidden="true">↗</span></a> is my [[Skool]] community for teaching advertising. I started it with Matt, then Joel joined. We won the Skool Games last year. Now we're the de facto group for learning ads on the platform.

Advertising is probably my highest monetizable skill. After [[Awake Happy]] taught me that passion without economics doesn't work, I pivoted hard into what I'm actually good at: running ads, building funnels, scaling info products.

Ads Lab bridges what I learned in e-commerce, film production (managing creative teams and information), and agency work into a teaching model that works. The [[Skool]] platform lets us build community around the skill instead of just delivering content.

Winning the Skool Games validated the approach, which connects to [[Gamification drives self-discovery]]—make learning visible, reward progress, keep people engaged. Same principles I'm applying to [[Commune]].

The skill transfer is direct: [[Business management is fundamentally the management of expanding context]]. Ads Lab manages client context (offers, audiences, goals). [[Commune]] manages personal context (thinking, knowledge, story). Different applications, same core skill.

Ads Lab proves the model works. [[Commune]] takes it deeper—from teaching a skill to externalizing entire thought processes.
