Commune runs at home. Capture happens on the Box. So do drafts, clustering, and Ask-the-Brain over private notes. I only push what I approve to the public notebook. That split matters. I can pace and talk without worrying about leaks. I can manage my family docs, my businesses, and my wiki from one place.

Readers still get a great surface. They see the notes I want to share. They see the [[Ledger replaces feeds]]. They can ask public questions against public notes with [[Ask the Brain]]. If I want to move to hosted later, I can. The Box stays the source of truth.

This is the answer to the anti-algorithm stance in [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]]. Ownership and privacy first. Then sharing. Not the other way around.

Box-first enables [[Voice in, approvals out]] because I can capture anything without fear. It supports [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI by leveraging structured, proprietary memory]] by keeping all context local. It also makes [[People pay to follow a working mind]] possible because readers trust that what they see is genuine, not optimized for engagement.

The Box is what makes [[Local-First Software]] practical for knowledge work at scale.
