People pay for polish. But I think the world is shifting. People will pay for access to a working mind over polished outputs. At least I hope so.

[[Commune]] replaces algorithmic feeds with a ledger. [[Ledger replaces feeds]] shows motion with small diffs and reasons. Not a GitHub changelog. AI analyzes the ledger to write weekly summaries ([[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]]), answer questions about how notes evolved, and surface patterns across changes. Clean titles and tight links make [[Ask the Brain]] return short answers with receipts. [[Three panes deep, then you pay]] lets anyone try before it locks.

The trade is recency and answers. I can see what changed and ask good questions, so I pay. Works if the surface stays calm and human. [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] replaces ranking. [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]] replaces likes.

Simple exchange. I show work in the open. People fund more work because they learn faster. [[The Commune box]] keeps capture private. Notebook stays readable ([[Notes beat posts for showing progress]]).

Fair business without traps. No engagement optimization. No artificial scarcity. No surveillance capitalism. Just clear value. Access to a thinking process that helps people think better.

[[Build in Public]] with sustainable economics from the start.
