<a href="https://cursor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="white-space:nowrap">Cursor<span class="external-link-icon" aria-hidden="true">â†—</span></a> is an AI-powered code editor. It was one of the tools that really shifted my mindset as to what's possible with LLMs and agents.

When [[Reflect]] couldn't handle the automation I needed and agents like Cursor came into the scene, I realized I needed to build [[Commune]]. Cursor showed me the future. AI that understands your codebase, your context, your intent.

That's the model I want for thinking. Not just code. [[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]] takes the same concept. AI that understands how I write, what I link, how I structure thoughts.

[[The Commune box]] runs locally like Cursor can. [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]] because it learns your specific patterns instead of serving millions of users with one model.

Cursor proved the interaction pattern works. Now I'm building it for notes.
