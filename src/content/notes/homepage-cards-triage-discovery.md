The homepage needs a way to triage people to interesting content without overwhelming them with everything at once.

Two cards side by side below the main note. Left card shows backlinks to the home note. Right card shows what I've been working on recently.

Both cards are static size at first. Truncated. You can expand them with a drawer slide if you want more. Fast animation. No jumping around.

The backlinks card is straightforward. Just links to notes that reference the home note. But the right card is more interesting.

The recent activity card shows [[Intelligent commit summaries replace verbose logs]]. Not raw git commits. AI-analyzed themes. "Devon's been refining thoughts on subscriptions this week" with links to the specific notes.

You can expand for more detail, but the full changelog is behind the paywall. Free users get the smart summary. Paid users get the complete history.

This is how [[Commune]] helps people follow what I'm thinking about without algorithmic feeds or noise.
