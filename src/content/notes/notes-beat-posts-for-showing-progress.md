Posts slow you down. Notes ship now. A post wants a mood and a full arc. A note makes one claim, links two or three neighbors, and moves on. That speed keeps readers inside the work. They can open three notes beside each other and see how the parts fit. That is better than waiting for a perfect essay.

Notes also make better inputs for agents. Short claims and strong titles feed [[Ask the Brain]]. Notes feed the weekly [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]] without breaking flow. Capture should be easy. I pace and talk. See [[Automated note shaping from voice]]. Approval should be fast. Create. Merge. Link. Do nothing.

The map should stay honest. [[Three panes deep, then you pay]] lets anyone try the path before meeting the paywall. Long story? Read the [[Release is a monthly human wrap]] that cites the [[Ledger replaces feeds]].

[[I hope people will pay for a working mind]] because readers see thinking in motion, not just polished conclusions. [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] works because each note can connect to any other note based on conceptual relationships.

Notes are the atomic unit of [[Evergreen Notes]] and the foundation of wikis.
