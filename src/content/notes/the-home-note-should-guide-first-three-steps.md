Blank slate paralysis kills exploration. Too many wikis dump readers into notes with no guidance. They click around, get lost, leave.

The home note fixes this. Guide the first three clicks. Not required paths—suggested starting points based on different interests.

[[Commune]] offers three paths:
1. Read today's ledger and last week's summary
2. Ask the brain about what interests you
3. Follow if you want updates, collect notes for your own trail

One option feels limiting. Five feels overwhelming. Three gives choice without paralysis.

Recent work? Check the ledger. Specific question? Ask. Want ongoing updates? Follow. Different goals, different paths.

[[Depth-3 free is honest gating]] lets you explore three panes deep before hitting a wall. The home note is where that exploration starts. First three clicks are always free.

The guidance changes based on context. Homepage for first-timers. Category pages for topic exploration. Note pages for people already deep in the wiki.

Traditional wikis assume everyone knows how to navigate linked notes. Most don't. Guide them or they bounce.

The notes matter, but discoverability determines whether anyone reads them.
