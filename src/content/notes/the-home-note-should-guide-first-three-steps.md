[[Commune]] requires a starting note. The first note when someone lands on your site. You must design it. No blank slate.

It triages readers to your best ideas. Not a comprehensive index. Not your entire graph. Just the entry points that matter most right now.

My home note links to [[Ledger replaces feeds]], [[Ask the Brain]], and [[The Commune box]]. Those are my current best ideas for understanding what I'm building. Next month it might change. Year from now it'll definitely change.

Home note evolves. As your thinking changes, update it. Dead links get pruned. New concepts get added. Reflects where your mind is right now, not where it was.

Traditional wikis dump readers into notes with no guidance. They click around, get lost, leave. Home note fixes this by giving clear starting points.

Design it like triage. Different readers want different things. Give them paths to what matters. Not required paths, just obvious places to start based on what you think is important.
