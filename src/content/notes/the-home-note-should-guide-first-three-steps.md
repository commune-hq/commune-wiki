Blank slate paralysis kills exploration. Too many wikis dump readers in with no guidance. They click around, get lost, leave.

Home note fixes this. Guide the first three clicks. Not required paths—suggested starting points.

[[Commune]] offers three paths:
1. Read the ledger and last week's summary
2. Ask the brain what interests you
3. Follow for updates, collect notes for your own trail

One option feels limiting. Five feels overwhelming. Three gives choice without paralysis.

Recent work? Ledger. Specific question? Ask. Ongoing updates? Follow. Different goals, different paths.

[[Three panes deep, then you pay]] lets you explore three clicks before hitting a wall. Home note is where that starts. First three clicks always free.

Traditional wikis assume everyone knows how to navigate linked notes. Most don't. Guide them or they bounce.

Notes matter, but discoverability determines whether anyone reads them.
