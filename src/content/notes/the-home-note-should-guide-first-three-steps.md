[[Commune]] requires a starting note. First note visitors see when they land on a site. I pick which note that is. Can't leave it blank or random.

My home note triages readers to my best ideas. Not a comprehensive index. Not my entire graph. Just the entry points that matter most right now.

I link to [[Ledger replaces feeds]], [[Ask the Brain]], and [[The Commune box]]. Those are my current best ideas for understanding what I'm building. Next month it might change. Year from now it'll definitely change.

My home note evolves. As my thinking changes, I update it. Dead links get pruned. New concepts get added. Reflects where my mind is right now, not where it was.

Traditional wikis dump readers in with no guidance. They click around, get lost, leave. Home note fixes this by giving clear starting points.

I design it like triage. Different readers want different things. I give them paths to what matters. Not required paths, just obvious places to start based on what I think is important.
