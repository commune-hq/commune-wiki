summary: "New readers need clear starting points. The homepage suggests three initial paths. Prevents choice paralysis."

Blank slate paralysis kills exploration. Too many wikis dump readers into an undifferentiated mass of notes with no guidance. Result: they leave.

The solution: the homepage explicitly guides the first three clicks. Not three required pathsâ€”three suggested starting points based on different interests.

[[Commune]]'s approach:
1. Read today's ledger and last week's summary
2. Ask the brain about what interests you
3. Follow if you want updates, collect notes for your own trail

This works because it addresses different reader goals:
- Curious about recent work? Ledger.
- Have a specific question? Ask.
- Want ongoing updates? Follow.

Three is intentional. One option feels limiting. Five feels overwhelming. Three gives choice without paralysis.

This connects to [[Depth-3 free is honest gating]]. The first three hops from the homepage are always accessible. Deeper exploration requires payment. The homepage starts the journey that the depth limit completes.

The guidance changes based on context. Homepage for first-time visitors. Category pages for people exploring specific topics. Note pages for people already deep in the wiki.

Traditional wikis assume everyone knows how to navigate linked notes. Most don't. Explicit guidance helps readers find value before giving up.

This is infrastructure, not content. The notes matter, but discoverability determines whether anyone reads them.
