summary: "Research on successful 'box' products like Raspberry Pi, Umbrel, and Home Assistant. Key lesson: software-first, hardware optional. Validate PMF before custom hardware."

Analyzed Raspberry Pi, Umbrel, Home Assistant, NextCloud Box, and Synology to understand hardware + software ecosystems. The question: should [[The Commune box]] be our first product or eventual endgame?

## Key Findings

**Software-first wins**: Home Assistant Yellow discontinued Oct 2025 because users preferred installing software on their own hardware. Open source software undermines official hardware sales unless ecosystem value is extremely high.

**Community > specs**: Raspberry Pi has 67% market share despite competitors with better hardware. Ecosystem (forums, docs, 40M units sold) creates network effects. Community is everything.

**Pricing validated**: $299-500 sweet spot for premium home servers. Umbrel Home ($399), Synology DS425+ ($499) prove market exists. But must offer compelling advantage over DIY.

## What We Researched

50,000+ words across Raspberry Pi strategy, Umbrel architecture, Home Assistant discontinuation analysis, self-hosting community sentiment from 2024-2025.

## Recommendations

**Bootstrap software first**: Validate [[Commune]] wiki + agent product-market fit before hardware investment. Avoid NextCloud Box mistake (launched hardware without proven software demand).

**Offer rebadged mini PC later**: If software PMF proven, offer pre-configured $299 mini PC (Intel N100, 16GB RAM). Convenience premium, not proprietary hardware.

**Badge system for ownership**: Show "Self-Hosted" vs "Commune Box" vs "Cloud-Hosted" badges on profiles. Status signal without gating functionality.
