A lot of middleware becomes redundant. Start putting everything on the server—taxes, documents. Connect to Xero or QuickBooks. The agents can read files, parse data. You start to get to a point where you might not need a bookkeeper anymore. And because you own all the data, your shit's gonna be better.

Traditional business infrastructure is built on artificial boundaries:
- Accounting software that doesn't talk to marketing tools
- Customer support systems isolated from sales data
- Financial data locked in specialized applications
- Creative assets scattered across different platforms

When you own the infrastructure, these boundaries dissolve. Everything connects naturally because it's all on your system, under your control.

Roles that become partially or fully automated:
- **Bookkeeping**: AI can categorize transactions, match invoices, generate reports
- **Data analysis**: No need for specialized BI roles when the system provides integrated insights
- **Project coordination**: [[A sufficiently intelligent router eliminates the need for traditional project management]]
- **Information management**: No more dedicated roles for organizing and maintaining data

This enables [[Integrated data analysis unlocks observations impossible in siloed systems]]. When you control the full stack, you can optimize for insight rather than compatibility.

The key insight: middleware exists because systems don't talk to each other. When you own everything, you don't need translation layers—you need intelligence layers.

This is why [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]]. Your system gets better by leveraging structured, proprietary memory—it has access to your complete context, not just the fragments that individual SaaS tools can see.
