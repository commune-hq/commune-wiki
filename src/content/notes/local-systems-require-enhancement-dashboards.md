Transcripts should be raw-dogged initially. Get the full, imperfect transcript onto the daily note. Then, you need an "Enhancement Dashboard." It's like the utilities Apple and Google use to improve face detection. We need systems like that for training local models: refining semantic search relevance, correcting transcription errors (Mad Libs style when the transcript is fucked), and training entity recognition.

The challenge with local AI is that you don't have the massive datasets that train cloud models. But you have something better: you have perfect context about your specific use case and preferences.

Enhancement Dashboard features:
- **Transcription correction**: Mad Libs-style interface for fixing speech-to-text errors
- **Semantic search training**: Rate search results to improve relevance
- **Entity recognition**: Teach the system about your specific people, places, and concepts
- **Style preferences**: Train the system on how you like information organized and presented
- **Relationship mapping**: Help the AI understand connections between concepts and people

This connects to [[The router's primary challenge is updating knowledge bases tastefully and non-destructively]]. The Enhancement Dashboard is how you teach the system your definition of "tasteful."

This is also why [[Accurate transcription requires training the model on personal proper nouns and context]]. The system needs to learn your specific vocabulary and context.

The competitive advantage is that your system gets better at serving *you* specifically, rather than being optimized for the average user across millions of people.
