summary: Notes written to evolve and compound over time, not dumped into an archive. Foundation of personal knowledge management.
---

Evergreen notes evolve and compound over time instead of getting dumped into an archive. [[Externalizing thought builds a cognitive scaffold for solving complex problems]] by creating persistent thinking tools.

Each note expresses a single idea ([[Atomic Notes]]). Notes gain value through connections ([[Associative linking over hierarchies]]), not folder structures. They improve through revision. Start as rough captures, reach evergreen status through [[Titles are takeaways, not labels]] and clear claims.

Traditional note-taking creates piles of write-only notes ([[Manual file management is a high-friction waste of cognitive resources]]). Evergreen notes create a thinking system that compounds. Each note makes future notes easier to write and more valuable. [[Notes beat posts for showing progress]] in knowledge work.

[[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]] works because I capture rough thoughts knowing they'll be refined over time. [[Ask the Brain]] works because the knowledge base has clear, atomic claims. [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]] because my personal terminology and connections become part of the model's context.

[[Andy Matuschak's Notes]] demonstrated the power of [[Networked thinking reveals hidden connections]] for serious intellectual work. Requires [[The Commune box]] to work at scale. Need complete control over the knowledge base to build genuine expertise over years.
