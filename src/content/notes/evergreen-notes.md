summary: Atomic, densely-linked notes that compound over time - the foundation of personal knowledge management.
---

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, rather than being dumped into an archive.

## Core Principles

**Atomic**: Each note should express a single idea. See [[Atomic Notes]].

**Densely Linked**: Notes gain value through connections. Related: [[Associative Linking Over Hierarchies]].

**Iterative**: Notes improve through revision. They start as [[Seed Notes]], grow through use, and eventually reach evergreen status.

## Why This Matters

Traditional note-taking creates piles of write-only notes. Evergreen notes create a **thinking system** that compounds - each note makes future notes easier to write and more valuable.

This is how [[Commune]] approaches knowledge: every capture becomes part of a living, interconnected graph.
