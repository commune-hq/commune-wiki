summary: Atomic, densely-linked notes that compound over time - the foundation of personal knowledge management.

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, rather than being dumped into an archive. They embody [[Externalizing thought builds cognitive scaffold]] by creating persistent thinking tools.

Each note should express a single idea through [[Atomic Notes]] principles. Notes gain value through connections via [[Associative linking over hierarchies]], not folder structures. They improve through revision, starting as rough captures and eventually reaching evergreen status through [[Titles are takeaways, not labels]] and clear claims.

Traditional note-taking creates piles of write-only notes that become [[Manual file management is high-friction waste]]. Evergreen notes create a **thinking system** that compoundsâ€”each note makes future notes easier to write and more valuable. This is why [[Notes beat posts for showing progress]] in knowledge work.

The approach enables [[Voice in, approvals out]] because you can capture rough thoughts knowing they'll be refined over time. It supports [[Ask the Brain]] by creating a searchable knowledge base with clear, atomic claims. The system works through [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]] because your personal terminology and connections become part of the model's context.

This is how [[Andy Matuschaks Notes]] demonstrated the power of [[Personal Knowledge Graphs]] for serious intellectual work. The method requires [[Box-first earns trust]] to work at scale because you need complete control over your knowledge base to build genuine expertise over years.
