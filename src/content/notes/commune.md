**Welcome to my Public Workbench.**

I'm Devon. I'm an artist and I build systems because I'm obsessed with reducing bullshit overhead. We spend way too much time managing information and not enough time actually *creating* shit.

I'm building Communeâ€”a platform that uses private, self-hosted AI to automate the organization of life, knowledge, and digital action. This site is where I dump my realizations and document the build in real-time.

## The Hook

Fuck file management.

The real promise of AI isn't some chatbot assistant; it's augmentation. We're moving past the era of digital chores and into an era of intelligent, private automation. It's time to stop organizing and start focusing.

## Core Realizations

- [[Manual file management is a high-friction waste of cognitive resources]]
- [[A sufficiently intelligent router eliminates the need for traditional project management]]
- [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI by leveraging structured, proprietary memory]]
- [[Integrated data analysis unlocks observations impossible in siloed systems]]

## How I Operate

- [[Defaulting to No for unscheduled calls protects deep work]]
- [[Externalizing thought builds a cognitive scaffold for solving complex problems]]

## Architecture

- **iOS App**: Fast capture and approvals
- **Mobile Gateway**: Routes intents to specialized handlers  
- **Agent Runtime**: Plans and executes via Cursor CLI
- **Knowledge Bases**: Git + Markdown + [[Evergreen Notes]]
- **Public Wiki**: Selective publishing with [[Andy Matuschak's Notes|Andy-style browsing]]

## The Technical Challenge

The core IP is [[The router's primary challenge is updating knowledge bases tastefully and non-destructively]]. Anyone can dump information into files. The sophistication is in tasteful integration that preserves quality and maintains personal style.

## Why This Matters

Most AI tools treat you as a data source. Commune treats AI as a **tool you control**, running on **infrastructure you own**.

This enables [[Owning your data infrastructure eliminates the need for specialized middleware and roles]] and unlocks [[Deeply personalized AI can analyze relationships and optimize communication strategies]].
