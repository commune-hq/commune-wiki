I'm Devon Meadows. Dad. Thinker. Tinkerer. I'm building [[Commune]] (that's what's powering this site). I also run [[Ads Lab]] and [[Awake Happy]]. This is my working brain in public.

I walk and talk into my phone. AI turns that into drafts ([[Voice in, approvals out]]). I approve or toss. I see what changed in the [[Ledger replaces feeds]]. Three clicks from here are open. Deeper branches lock ([[Three panes deep, then you pay]]).

Ask questions and get answers with receipts ([[Ask the Brain]]). See a fix? Leave a suggestion. I review it and the [[Ledger replaces feeds]] shows the change ([[Suggestions and Proposals make readers part of the work]]).

Everything runs on my home serverâ€”hosting, data, app, all of it ([[The Commune box]]).

The sliding panes owe a debt to [[Andy Matuschak's Notes]]. His work showed how interface shapes thinking.
