summary: Local-first personal AI infrastructure running on a home server - your private thinking partner.
---

Commune is a **local-first agentic OS** that runs on hardware you control. It's designed to be your private thinking partner - capturing, organizing, and acting on your knowledge without sending data to the cloud.

## Core Principles

**Local-First**: Your data lives on a box at home. No cloud dependencies, no vendor lock-in.

**Git-Driven**: Everything versioned. See [[Git as Database]].

**Privacy by Default**: Private unless explicitly marked public. See [[Selective Publishing]].

**Human-in-the-Loop**: AI agents propose, humans approve. Related: [[Agentic Workflows]].

## Architecture

- **iOS App**: Fast capture and approvals
- **Mobile Gateway**: Routes intents to specialized handlers
- **Agent Runtime**: Plans and executes via Cursor CLI
- **Knowledge Bases**: Git + Markdown + [[Evergreen Notes]]
- **Public Wiki**: Selective publishing with [[Andy Matuschak's Notes|Andy-style browsing]]

## Why This Matters

Most AI tools treat you as a data source. Commune treats AI as a **tool you control**, running on **infrastructure you own**.

This enables true privacy, customization, and ownership - the foundation for long-term personal AI.
