I'm Devon Meadows. Dad. Thinker. Tinkerer. I'm building [[What is Commune|Commune]] and I run <a href="https://noontide.co/adslab?utm_source=devonmeadows&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=bio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="white-space:nowrap">Ads Lab&nbsp;<span class="external-link-icon" aria-hidden="true">↗</span></a> and <a href="https://awakehappy.com/?utm_source=devonmeadows&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=bio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="white-space:nowrap">Awake Happy&nbsp;<span class="external-link-icon" aria-hidden="true">↗</span></a>. This is my working brain in public.

I capture by voice while I walk. The agent turns that into drafts. I approve or toss. See [[Voice in, approvals out]]. You'll see what changed in the [[Ledger replaces feeds]]. Three hops from here are open; deeper branches lock, which keeps this sane. See [[Depth-3 free is honest gating]].

No feed. No vibes machine. Discovery is time, follows, and a clear reason for every link. See [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] and [[Related and Stroll give serendipity without a feed]].

You can follow for updates or collect notes to build your own trail. See [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]]. You can ask questions and get short answers with receipts. See [[Ask the Brain]]. If you've got a fix or an edge case, leave a suggestion; I review it and the record updates in the [[Ledger replaces feeds]]. See [[Suggestions and Proposals make readers part of the work]].

Everything private runs on my box at home. I only publish what I approve. See [[Box-first earns trust]].

Right now I'm focused on a calm, paid surface that respects attention. I'm also crossing systems work with practice—notes on tech next to notes on focus. See [[Zen practice protects attention]].

The sliding panes interface here owes a debt to [[Andy Matuschak's Notes]]. His work showed how interface shapes thinking.

If you're new, skim today's ledger and last week's wrap: [[Ledger replaces feeds]] and [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]]. Then ask the brain about whatever catches your eye.
