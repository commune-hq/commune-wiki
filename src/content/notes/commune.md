I'm Devon Meadows. Dad. Thinker. Tinkerer. I'm building [[Commune]] (that's what's powering this website). I also run [[Ads Lab]] and [[Awake Happy]]. This is my working brain in public.

I capture by voice while I walk. The agent turns that into drafts. I approve or toss. See [[Voice in, approvals out]]. You'll see what changed in the [[Ledger replaces feeds]]. Three hops from here are open; deeper branches lock, which keeps this sane. See [[Three panes deep, then you pay]].

No feed. No vibes machine. Discovery is time, follows, and a clear reason for every link. See [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] and [[Related and Stroll give serendipity without a feed]].

You can follow for updates or collect notes to build your own trail. See [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]]. You can ask questions and get short answers with receipts. See [[Ask the Brain]]. If you've got a fix or an edge case, leave a suggestion; I review it and the record updates in the [[Ledger replaces feeds]]. See [[Suggestions and Proposals make readers part of the work]].

Everything private runs on my box at home. I only publish what I approve. See [[The Commune box]].

Right now I'm focused on a calm, paid surface that respects attention. I'm also crossing systems work with practiceâ€”notes on tech next to notes on focus. See [[Zen practice protects attention]].

The sliding panes interface here owes a debt to [[Andy Matuschak's Notes]]. His work showed how interface shapes thinking.

If you're new, skim today's ledger and last week's wrap: [[Ledger replaces feeds]] and [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]]. Then ask the brain about whatever catches your eye.
