**Welcome to my Public Workbench.**

I'm Devon. I'm an artist and I build systems because I'm obsessed with reducing bullshit overhead. We spend way too much time managing information and not enough time actually *creating* shit.

I'm building Commune—a platform that uses private, self-hosted AI to automate the organization of life, knowledge, and digital action. This site is where I dump my realizations and document the build in real-time.

## The Hook

Fuck file management.

The real promise of AI isn't some chatbot assistant; it's augmentation. We're moving past the era of digital chores and into an era of intelligent, private automation. It's time to stop organizing and start focusing.

## Core Realizations

- [[Manual file management is high-friction waste]]
- [[Intelligent router eliminates project management]]
- [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]]
- [[Integrated data analysis unlocks impossible observations]]

## How I Operate

- [[Defaulting to No protects deep work]]
- [[Externalizing thought builds cognitive scaffold]]

## Architecture

- **iOS App**: Fast capture and approvals
- **Mobile Gateway**: Routes intents to specialized handlers  
- **Agent Runtime**: Plans and executes via Cursor CLI
- **Knowledge Bases**: Git + Markdown + [[Evergreen Notes]]
- **Public Wiki**: Selective publishing with [[Andy Matuschaks Notes|Andy-style browsing]]

## The Technical Challenge

The core IP is [[Router tasteful knowledge integration]]. Anyone can dump information into files. The sophistication is in tasteful integration that preserves quality and maintains personal style.

## Why This Matters

Most AI tools treat you as a data source. Commune treats AI as a **tool you control**, running on **infrastructure you own**.

This enables [[Owning data infrastructure eliminates middleware]] and unlocks [[Personalized AI optimizes communication strategies]].

## Related Concepts

- [[Local-First Software]]
- [[Personal Knowledge Graphs]]
- [[Build in Public]]

## How This Works

Digital gardens are cool, but managing them sucks. This is different.

I don't manage folders or links here. I just dump thoughts into my phone. My private AI agents (running on my secure Commune box) handle the rest. They synthesize the messy inputs, connect the dots, organize the insights, and update this site—all while preserving my voice.

Honestly? It's the best way ever invented to build a public knowledge base.

## Want This For Yourself?

I do bespoke, high-ticket installations for busy individuals who want this level of automation without the setup.

**Starting at $10k for a complete system.**
