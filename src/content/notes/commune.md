I'm Devon Meadows. Dad. Thinker. Tinkerer. I'm building [[Commune]]—that's what's powering this site. I also run [[Ads Lab]] and [[Awake Happy]]. This is my working brain in public.

I walk and talk into my phone. AI turns that into drafts ([[Voice in, approvals out]]). I approve or toss. You see what changed in the [[Ledger replaces feeds]]. Three clicks from here are open. Deeper branches lock ([[Three panes deep, then you pay]]).

No feed. No algorithm. Discovery runs on time, who you follow, and why you're here ([[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]]). [[Related and Stroll give serendipity without a feed]].

You can follow for updates. Collect notes to build your own trail ([[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]]). Ask questions and get answers with receipts ([[Ask the Brain]]). See a fix? Leave a suggestion. I review it and the [[Ledger replaces feeds]] shows the change ([[Suggestions and Proposals make readers part of the work]]).

Everything private runs on my box at home ([[The Commune box]]). I only publish what I approve.

Right now I'm building a calm paid surface that respects attention. Systems work next to practice—tech notes next to focus notes ([[Zen practice protects attention]]).

The sliding panes owe a debt to [[Andy Matuschak's Notes]]. His work showed how interface shapes thinking.

New here? Skim the [[Ledger replaces feeds]] and last week's wrap ([[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]]). Then ask the brain whatever catches your eye.
