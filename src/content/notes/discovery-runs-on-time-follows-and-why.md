I do not want a For-You page. I want time and intent. Discovery starts with two lists. What I made and who I follow. Sort by updated time. That is it. Serendipity should feel earned, not fed.

We get that with [[Related and Stroll give serendipity without a feed]]. Each link shows a clear "why." Shared topic. Co-mentions. Link neighborhood. Collected-together. No secret sauce. Social stays simple with [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]].

Collect builds human trails that others can browse. Staff Picks can exist, but they are labeled and small. Cross-notebook is opt-in and respects [[Three panes deep, then you pay]]. This keeps attention clean, which matters if I want a brain that thinks rather than reacts. See [[Zen practice protects attention]].

The result is slower but better. People find quality by following people and following reasons. Not by training an addiction. This pairs with [[Ledger replaces feeds]] to replace ranking with time and intent, supporting [[I hope people will pay for a working mind]] through transparent, non-manipulative discovery.

Time-based discovery also enables [[Automated note shaping from voice]] because I can publish frequently without worrying about algorithmic punishment for "low engagement" content.
