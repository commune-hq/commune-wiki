I do not want a For-You page. I want time and intent. Discovery starts with two lists. What I made and who I follow. Sort by updated time. That's it. Serendipity should feel earned, not fed.

[[Related and Stroll give serendipity without a feed]]. Each link shows a clear "why." Shared topic. Co-mentions. Link neighborhood. Collected together. No secret sauce. Social stays simple with [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]].

Collect builds human trails that others can browse. Staff Picks can exist, but they're labeled and small. Cross-notebook is opt-in and respects [[Three panes deep, then you pay]]. Attention stays clean. Brain thinks instead of reacts.

The result is slower but better. People find quality by following people and following reasons. Not by training an addiction. [[See what I'm working on]] replaces ranking with time and intent.

Time-based discovery means I can publish frequently without worrying about algorithmic punishment for "low engagement" content. [[Automated note shaping from voice]] works because the platform doesn't optimize for virality.
