summary: AI generates OG images for notes automatically. Template-based, regenerates on major edits. Required for SEO/GEO but manual creation doesn't scale.
---

Rich results in Google and LLM citations need images. Every article needs an OG image.

Manual image creation doesn't scale with [[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]]. If I'm creating 10 notes in a day from voice dumps, I can't manually design 10 images.

Solution: auto-generate them. Template system where you choose an image style. AI generates an image for each note. When the note gets a major edit, regenerate. Minor edits don't trigger new images.

Maybe the images only show in meta tags for SEO. Maybe they also display on the frontend. Haven't decided yet.

This is a paid feature for [[Commune]] creators. Part of the "dump thoughts, make money" workflow. You focus on thinking, the system handles the optimization.

Combined with [[SEO-optimized atomic notes]], this means every note is fully optimized for discovery without manual work.

Open questions: Which image generation model? How to detect "major edit" vs "minor edit"? Template design system?
