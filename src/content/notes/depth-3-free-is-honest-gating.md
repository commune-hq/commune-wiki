Free needs a clear edge. Three steps from Home are open. You can land, click twice, and learn enough to care. Past that, it locks. The lock is visible on notes and on the mind map. People do not hit surprise paywalls. They see the map. They choose.

Paid members unlock deeper context, provenance extras, and [[Ask the Brain]]. The [[Ledger replaces feeds]] still shows what changed on both sides. This gate also helps me design. I decide which branches to keep open. I plan what becomes member-only.

Cheap walls make enemies. Clear walls make fans. Depth-3 fits the "open library" spirit while keeping enough value to fund the work. If a branch should be public forever, I can pin those links to [[The Home note should guide the first three steps]]. The rest earns its keep behind the gate.

This approach respects [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] because the gating is based on depth, not algorithmic manipulation. It supports [[People pay to follow a working mind]] by providing clear value without artificial scarcity.

The three-hop limit forces me to make the free content genuinely useful while creating natural upgrade moments for readers who want to go deeper.
