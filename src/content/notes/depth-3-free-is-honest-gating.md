[[Commune]] lets creators gate their public wiki at any depth. Three pane levels is the default. You land on the home note. [[The home note triages to your best ideas]]. Click through two more levels, then you hit a wall.

The wall is visible. You see what's locked before you click.

Become a subscriber and you can access deeper levels. [[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]]—different pricing tiers unlock different depths.

Three levels is enough to learn if the wiki is worth following. Too shallow, people bounce. Too deep, nobody pays.

Helps me design too. I decide which branches stay public. Pin the important stuff near the home note. Let the rest live behind the gate.

Clear walls work better than cheap walls. I hope [[I hope people will pay for a working mind]] when the value is obvious upfront.
