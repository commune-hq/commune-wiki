Free tier gives you three pane levels deep. You land on [[The Home note should guide the first three steps]], click through two more levels, then hit a wall.

The lock is visible on notes and on the mind map. No surprise paywalls. You see what's gated before you click. You choose whether to subscribe.

[[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]] explains the full pricing. Paid members get deeper exploration, [[Ask the Brain]] over all notes, provenance history, commit analysis. [[Ledger replaces feeds]] shows what changed on both sides of the gate.

Three panes is enough to learn if you care. Too shallow and people bounce. Too deep and nobody pays. Three hits the balance.

Cheap walls make enemies. Clear walls make fans. The gate respects [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]]—depth-based, not algorithmic manipulation. [[People pay to follow a working mind]] because the value is obvious before paying.

The three-pane limit also helps me design. I decide which branches stay open. Pin the evergreen stuff to the home note. Let the rest earn its keep behind the gate.
