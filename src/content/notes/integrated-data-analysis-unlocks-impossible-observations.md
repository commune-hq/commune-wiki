Imagine Shopify, Google ads, Facebook ads, Klaviyo, customer support, *and* my own stream of consciousness all connected. You could start to understand profitability correlating with certain strategies, seasonal events, or even the creative style of the graphics (if the model understands the graphics). "We make more money when Joel does the ads versus when Devon does the ads." You can't make those nuanced observations unless you overlap everything.

Traditional business intelligence fails because it operates on artificial boundaries. Marketing data stays in marketing tools, financial data stays in accounting software, creative insights stay in your head.

The breakthrough comes from integration:
- **Cross-domain patterns**: See how personal energy affects business performance
- **Creative correlation**: Understand which creative approaches drive actual revenue
- **Relationship dynamics**: Track how different team members' work styles impact outcomes
- **Temporal insights**: Identify seasonal patterns across all business dimensions

This is why [[Business management is fundamentally the management of expanding context]]. The value isn't in the individual data points—it's in the connections between them.

This also enables [[Deeply personalized AI can analyze relationships and optimize communication strategies]]. When you have comprehensive context about relationships and outcomes, you can optimize for better results.

The competitive advantage is profound: businesses that can synthesize all their context will consistently outperform businesses stuck in departmental silos.
