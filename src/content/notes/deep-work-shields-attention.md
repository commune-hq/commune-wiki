When I'm on my computer, my goal is deep work. Focused, uninterrupted thinking that actually produces something. Not shallow browsing, not context-switching, not meetings. Real work.

[[Daily walks attract downloads]] protect this by giving me a break before I burn out. If I work straight through without a walk, I lose the ability to focus deeply. I'm mentally fried by dinner and can't be present with my family. The walk isn't a break from deep work. It's what makes deep work sustainable.

Both [[Unscheduled quick calls destroy deep work]] and [[Defaulting to No for unscheduled calls protects deep work]] are boundaries I've built to protect focus. Quick calls fragment attention. Saying "no" by default keeps my calendar clear.

The phrase "deep work" comes from Cal Newport, but the practice is ancient. It's what happens when I eliminate distractions and think hard about one thing for hours. [[Zen practice protects attention]] does this too. Meditation trains the muscle of sustained focus.

For me, deep work happens in the morning and right after my afternoon walk. That post-walk sprint before dinner is gold. My mind is clear, I've processed thoughts on the walk, and I can hammer out real progress.

I learned that [[Business management is fundamentally the management of expanding context]]. The job isn't to do more tasks. It's to protect the conditions for deep work. If I can't think clearly, nothing else matters.
