summary: Each note should express exactly one idea - the foundation of composable knowledge.
---

An atomic note focuses on a single, self-contained idea. This makes notes:

- **Reusable**: Link to them from multiple contexts
- **Composable**: Combine them to build complex arguments
- **Maintainable**: Update one idea without breaking others

## Contrast with Traditional Notes

Traditional notes often mix multiple concepts, making them hard to reference precisely. Atomic notes solve this by splitting topics into their constituent ideas.

## In Practice

When writing an [[Evergreen Notes|evergreen note]], ask: "What's the **one** idea here?" If there are multiple, split into separate notes.

This creates a [[Personal Knowledge Graphs|knowledge graph]] where each node represents a distinct concept.
