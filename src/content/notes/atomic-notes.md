summary: Each note should express exactly one idea. This is a key property of Evergreen Notes that makes them reusable and composable.

One note, one idea. This is a core principle of [[Evergreen Notes]].

Atomic notes are reusable. You can link from multiple contexts without baggage. They're composable. Combine them to build arguments. They're maintainable. Update one idea without breaking others ([[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]]).

Traditional notes mix multiple concepts. Hard to reference precisely. Same problem as [[Manual file management is a high-friction waste of cognitive resources]]. Too many decisions bundled together. Atomic notes split topics into constituent ideas.

Writing an evergreen note? Ask: "What's the one idea here?" Multiple ideas means split into separate notes. Requires [[Titles are takeaways, not labels]] because each title captures a specific claim.

Each note is a distinct concept. [[Ask the Brain]] provides precise answers because queries target specific ideas, not mixed topics. [[Notes beat posts for showing progress]] because you publish individual insights as they develop.

[[Associative linking over hierarchies]] works because atomic notes create precise connection points. [[Andy Matuschak's Notes]] pioneered this. [[Build in Public]] works better with small focused notes than monolithic documents.
