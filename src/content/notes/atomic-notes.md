summary: Each note should express exactly one idea - the foundation of composable knowledge.
---

An atomic note focuses on a single, self-contained idea, which enables [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] by creating precise connection points. This makes notes:

- **Reusable**: Link to them from multiple contexts without conceptual baggage
- **Composable**: Combine them to build complex arguments through [[Evergreen Notes]]
- **Maintainable**: Update one idea without breaking others, supporting [[Voice in, approvals out]]

Traditional notes often mix multiple concepts, making them hard to reference precisely. This creates the same problem as [[Manual file management is high-friction waste]]â€”too many decisions bundled together. Atomic notes solve this by splitting topics into their constituent ideas.

When writing an [[Evergreen Notes|evergreen note]], ask: "What's the **one** idea here?" If there are multiple, split into separate notes. This approach requires [[Titles are takeaways, not labels]] because each title must capture a specific claim.

This creates wikis where each note represents a distinct concept. The method enables [[Ask the Brain]] to provide precise answers because queries can target specific ideas rather than mixed topics. It supports [[Notes beat posts for showing progress]] because you can publish individual insights as they develop.

The atomic principle underlies [[Andy Matuschaks Notes]] and connects to [[Build in Public]] because small, focused notes are easier to share and discuss than monolithic documents.
