summary: Taking a 30-60 minute walk in the early afternoon protects deep work and mental presence with familyâ€”plus you get downloads from the universe.

I take a 30-60 minute walk most afternoons. It does three things. Gives me downloads, protects [[Deep work shields attention]], and keeps me present with my family.

The download part feels esoteric. Maybe it is. My friend Matt calls them "downloads from the universe." When I stare at a screen all day, I can't think clearly. There's something about peripheral vision and expansive thinking. Outside, I see the horizon. Trees. Mountains. My visual field opens up, and so does my mind.

I hit record in the [[Commune]] app and just talk. Sometimes I talk the whole time. Sometimes very little. It depends on the work. Some days I need to get away from work. Other days, I'm still processing it. Voice dumping raw thoughts that'll become [[Evergreen Notes]] later through [[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]].

If I don't take the walk, I work straight through from morning to dinner. My wife texts "making dinner" and I realize I haven't moved in eight hours. That leaves me mentally unavailable. My brain doesn't stop working all night. It's not fair to my family, and I don't want it to be like that. I want to spend time with my kid and my wife.

The walk resets me. It breaks the focus strain before dinner, so I can be present. That's more valuable than whatever extra hour of work I thought I'd get.

The voice dumps capture thinking I'd otherwise lose, which connects to how [[Externalizing thought builds a cognitive scaffold for solving complex problems]]. These walks often surface the insights worth sharing, which supports [[Build in Public]].
