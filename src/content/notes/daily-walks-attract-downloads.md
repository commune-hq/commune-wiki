summary: Taking a 30-60 minute walk in the early afternoon protects deep work and mental presence with family—plus you get downloads from the universe.

I take a 30-60 minute walk most afternoons. It does three things: gives me downloads, protects [[Deep work shields attention]], and keeps me present with my family.

The download part feels esoteric—maybe it is. My friend Matt calls them "downloads from the universe." When you stare at a screen all day, you can't think clearly. There's something about peripheral vision and expansive thinking. Outside, you see the horizon. Trees. Mountains. Your visual field opens up, and so does your mind.

I hit record in the [[Commune]] app and just talk. Sometimes I talk the whole time. Sometimes very little. It depends on the work. Some days I need to get away from work. Other days, I'm still processing it—voice dumping raw thoughts that'll become [[Evergreen Notes]] later through [[Voice in, approvals out]].

If I don't take the walk, I work straight through from morning to dinner. My wife texts "making dinner" and I realize I haven't moved in eight hours. That leaves me mentally unavailable. My brain doesn't stop working all night. It's not fair to my family, and I don't want it to be like that. I want to spend time with my kid and my wife.

The walk resets me. It breaks the focus strain before dinner, so I can be present. That's more valuable than whatever extra hour of work I thought I'd get.

The voice dumps capture thinking I'd otherwise lose, which connects to [[Externalizing thought builds cognitive scaffold]]. These walks often surface the insights worth sharing, which supports [[Build in Public]].
