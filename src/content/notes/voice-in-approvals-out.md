I pace and talk. That's the input. AI drafts a note, proposes links, shows a diff. I approve, merge, or toss. No tags to babysit. No graph gardening. The UI shows actions, not confidence. [[Zen practice protects attention]] because capture stays calm.

If the draft sounds like a bot, it waits. If it sounds like me, it ships. My voice stays intact. My pace stays high.

Clear notes feed [[Ask the Brain]]. Real edits feed the [[Ledger replaces feeds]]. The weekly wrap ([[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]]) pulls from both.

[[The Commune box]] keeps capture private. Heavy compute lives at home ([[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]]). The public side stays small and sharp. That's how you publish daily without burning out ([[People pay to follow a working mind]]).

I don't think about where thoughts go or how to organize them. I speak. The system routes. [[A sufficiently intelligent router eliminates the need for traditional project management]] handles the rest. [[Defaulting to No for unscheduled calls protects deep work]] becomes possible.

Voice capture removes friction between thinking and recording ([[Externalizing thought builds a cognitive scaffold for solving complex problems]]). Ideas flow from mind to system without typing or organizing. [[Notes beat posts for showing progress]] because you can capture atomic thoughts immediately. [[Manual file management is a high-friction waste of cognitive resources]]â€”voice capture eliminates that.
