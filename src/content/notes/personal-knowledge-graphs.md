Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) model individual understanding as networks of interconnected concepts, relationships, and contexts. Unlike traditional databases, they capture the **semantic relationships** between ideas.

Key components:
- **Entities**: People, concepts, projects, documents
- **Relationships**: How entities connect (influences, contains, contradicts)
- **Context**: When, where, and why connections matter
- **Provenance**: Sources and confidence levels

This enables queries impossible with traditional search:
- "Show me all concepts that influenced my thinking about automation"
- "What projects connect Sarah, the Q4 launch, and pricing strategy?"
- "Find contradictions in my notes about remote work"

PKGs excel at **cross-domain insight generation**. By representing knowledge as a graph, patterns emerge across seemingly unrelated areas. A business insight might connect to a personal observation through shared underlying principles.

This connects to [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]] because PKGs provide the structured context that makes local AI systems more effective. They also relate to [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] as the technical implementation of networked thinking.

**Implementation challenge**: Balancing automatic relationship extraction with manual curation. Too much automation creates noise; too little misses connections.
