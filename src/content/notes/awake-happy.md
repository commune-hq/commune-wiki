summary: A clothing brand built on the idea that doing what you love matters—still running, still teaching me about margins, economics, and what makes a business sustainable.
---

[Awake Happy](https://awakehappy.com) is my clothing brand. I started it after burning out selling products I didn't care about in e-commerce. The premise: do what you love, the money will follow.

That's true—but incomplete.

Clothing is brutal on margins. You care deeply, design well, build a brand people connect with—but the numbers don't work unless you scale massive. I haven't gotten there yet. The business keeps teaching me: passion matters, but so do economics. Choose problems where the model works.

While running Awake Happy, I started [[Ads Lab]] to teach what I'm actually best at: running ads, building funnels, scaling info products. I didn't pivot away from the brand—I built on top of it. Ads Lab proved my highest monetizable skill is advertising, not designing t-shirts.

Awake Happy sits in my story between the Google Panda update that killed my Black Hat SEO business and the moment I discovered [[Commune]]. It's the chapter where I learned [[Business management is context management]]—you can't just make cool stuff. You have to manage the context around creation: cash flow, margins, distribution, customer acquisition costs.

The brand is still here. I'm still learning from it. And those lessons feed directly into [[Commune]]—where the model works. [[People pay to follow a working mind]]. [[Depth gating protects computation costs]] lets me charge for real value. The box lets super users own their data. It all clicks.

Awake Happy is school. [[Commune]] is the graduation project. [[Ads Lab]] is the bridge between them.
