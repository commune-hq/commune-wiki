summary: A clothing brand built on the idea that doing what you love matters—still running, still teaching me about margins, economics, and what makes a business sustainable.

<a href="https://awakehappy.com/?utm_source=devonmeadows&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="white-space:nowrap">Awake Happy<span class="external-link-icon" aria-hidden="true">↗</span></a> is my clothing brand. I started it after burning out selling products I didn't care about in e-commerce. The premise was do what you love, the money will follow.

That's true. But incomplete.

Clothing is brutal on margins. You care deeply, design well, build a brand people connect with. But the numbers don't work unless you scale massive. I haven't gotten there yet. The business keeps teaching me. Passion matters, but so do economics. Choose problems where the model works.

While running Awake Happy, I started [[Ads Lab]] to teach what I'm actually best at. Running ads, building funnels, scaling info products. I didn't pivot away from the brand. I built on top of it. Ads Lab proved my highest monetizable skill is advertising, not designing t-shirts.

Awake Happy sits in my story between the Google Panda update that killed my Black Hat SEO business and the moment I discovered [[Commune]]. That's when I learned [[Business management is fundamentally the management of expanding context]]. You can't just make cool stuff. You have to manage the context around creation. Cash flow, margins, distribution, customer acquisition costs.

The brand is still here. I'm still learning from it. Those lessons feed directly into [[Commune]], where the model works. [[I hope people will pay for a working mind]]. [[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]] lets me charge for real value. The box lets super users own their data. It all clicks.

Awake Happy is school. [[Commune]] is the graduation project. [[Ads Lab]] is the bridge between them.
