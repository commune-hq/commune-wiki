summary: A Commune feature marking notes that anchor key ideas in your wiki—top 5% by backlinks, inspired by Skool's approach to recognizing contributors.
---

The Star is a [[Commune]] feature that marks notes in the top 5% by backlinks. When other notes link to something often, it anchors key ideas in my wiki. The star (⭐) makes that visible.

Not about popularity. About centrality. When my wiki shows which ideas carry weight across my thinking, I see patterns I'd miss otherwise. System borrows from [[Skool]]'s approach. Recognize top contributors with a visible badge. Here, the badge goes to ideas, not people.

Stars appear inline with the title ([[Titles are takeaways, not labels|Skool-style]]), right next to the note name. Click the star, get a modal that explains what it means. No underlines, no distractions. Star is a separate element because clicking it opens the explanation, not the note.

Ranking logic lives in a single config file. I want to experiment. Maybe stars should factor in revisions, cross-theme links, or time decay. System needs to stay tunable because [[Evergreen Notes]] evolve, and what counts as "important" might shift as the wiki grows.

Stars help readers discover high-value notes without AI summaries ([[Subscription unlocks depth into the mind]]). They support [[Build in Public]] by showing what ideas compound over time. Feature emerged from wanting [[Gamification drives self-discovery]]. Surface the best work, make progress visible, keep people engaged.

For now, backlinks alone decide rankings. Top 5%, relative not absolute, to prevent gaming. Clean, simple, tunable.
