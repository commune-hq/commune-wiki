Local-first software inverts the cloud-centric model. Your data lives on your devices. Cloud services are optional sync layers, not required dependencies.

Files exist on your hardware, not just in the cloud. Full functionality works offline. No data mining or surveillance business models. Your data stays accessible even if services shut down.

You can switch tools without losing data. Your data never leaves your control. Work continues regardless of internet connectivity. Own your tools instead of renting them.

The challenge is collaboration. Local-first systems need sophisticated sync protocols to merge changes from multiple devices and users. CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) enable this without central servers.

[[Commune]]'s architecture follows this. AI runs locally, knowledge bases are Git repositories, cloud services are optional enhancements rather than dependencies.

Local-first doesn't mean local-only. It means local-capable with optional cloud features.
