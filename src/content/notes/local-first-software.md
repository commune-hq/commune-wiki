Local-first software inverts the cloud-centric model: your data lives on your devices, with cloud services as optional sync layers rather than required dependencies.

Core principles:
- **Data ownership**: Files exist on your hardware, not just in the cloud
- **Offline capability**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **Privacy by default**: No data mining or surveillance business models
- **Long-term access**: Your data remains accessible even if services shut down

This approach eliminates many problems with cloud software:
- **Vendor lock-in**: You can switch tools without losing data
- **Privacy violations**: Your data never leaves your control
- **Service outages**: Work continues regardless of internet connectivity
- **Subscription treadmills**: Own your tools, don't rent them

The challenge is collaboration. Local-first systems need sophisticated sync protocols to merge changes from multiple devices and users. Technologies like CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) enable this without central servers.

This philosophy drives [[Commune]]'s architecture: AI runs locally, knowledge bases are Git repositories, and cloud services are optional enhancements rather than dependencies.

**Key insight**: Local-first doesn't mean local-only. It means local-capable with optional cloud features.
