summary: I created a note in Reflect called "the higher self" with all my favorite books, articles, and methodologies. I'd run AI analysis over my voice dumps to get advice from my higher self and refine the prompt over time.

I created this note in [[Reflect]] called "the higher self" where I'd save all my favorite books, articles, and methodologies I appreciate. I'd refine it and refine it.

When I dumped my thoughts on walks, I'd run AI analysis over the entire dump to get advice from my higher self. It would clean up the transcript, format it into bullets and sub-bullets, and help me continuously improve the higher self prompt.

But the workflow was really limiting. I had to manually double-tap the entire transcript every time I walked. Run the analysis. It would spit it all out. I'd replace that giant chunk with the bullet sub-bullet syntax to make it look good in my notes.

If I had ideas about how to change the higher self prompt based on these outputs, I'd have to go to the note in Reflect and edit it. Then copy the whole thing, go to my AI prompt library in Reflect, replace the whole prompt, and save it. Really arduous.

The concept was right. Personal knowledge as a prompt. But [[Manual note refinement doesn't scale]]. [[Automated note shaping from voice]] does what the higher self prompt tried to do, but automatically.

[[The Commune box]] means the prompt can access all my notes in context. No manual copying. No locked-in data. Just the workflow working.
