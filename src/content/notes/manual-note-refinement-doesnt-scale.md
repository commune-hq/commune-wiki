summary: I used Reflect with a "higher self" prompt to refine my voice dumps. Had to manually select transcripts, run analysis, copy/paste formatted output, update the prompt. Too arduous. Couldn't get my data out. That's why I'm building Commune.

I used [[Reflect]] for years to quick capture my notes. I created this note called "the higher self" where I'd save all my favorite books, articles, and methodologies I appreciate. I'd refine it and refine it.

When I dumped my thoughts on walks, I'd run AI analysis over the entire dump to get advice from my higher self. It would clean up the transcript, format it into bullets and sub-bullets, and help me continuously improve the higher self prompt.

But the workflow was really limiting. I had to manually double-tap the entire transcript every time I walked. Run the analysis. It would spit it all out. I'd replace that giant chunk with the bullet sub-bullet syntax to make it look good in my notes.

If I had ideas about how to change the higher self prompt based on these outputs, I'd have to go to the note in Reflect and edit it. Then copy the whole thing, go to my AI prompt library in Reflect, replace the whole prompt, and save it. Really arduous.

At the end of the day, I couldn't use it all in context to do anything special. And I can't get any of my data out of Reflect. It's end-to-end encrypted. I can download it, but I'd have to download it every day and do something with it if I want to run automations and agent stuff.

Before Reflect, I used Obsidian. Before that, Voice Notes. I kept hitting the same wall. Good ideas, queen execution. Lost in translation.

That's why I decided to build my own thing. [[Commune]] automates the loop. [[Automated note shaping from voice]] does what I used to do manually. [[The Commune box]] means I own my data. [[Ask the Brain]] uses everything in context. No manual copying. No locked-in data. Just the workflow I always wanted.

Manual refinement works for a while. But it doesn't scale. You need the system to do the heavy lifting so you can focus on thinking, not formatting.
