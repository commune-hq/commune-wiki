summary: I used Reflect with a "higher self" prompt to refine my voice dumps. Had to manually select transcripts, run analysis, copy/paste formatted output, update the prompt. Too arduous. Couldn't get my data out. That's why I'm building Commune.

I used [[Reflect]] for years and built my own [[The higher self prompt]]. I'd dump thoughts on walks, run AI analysis, manually copy and paste formatted output. Really arduous.

The workflow hit a wall. [[Reflect]] is end-to-end encrypted. I'd have to download my data every time I want to run automations. Can't use everything in context. Can't automate the loop.

Before [[Reflect]], I used [[Obsidian]]. Before that, Voice Notes. I kept hitting the same wall. Good ideas, bad execution. Lost in translation.

That's why I decided to build [[Commune]]. [[Automated note shaping from voice]] does what I used to do manually. [[The Commune box]] means I own my data. [[Ask the Brain]] uses everything in context. No manual copying. No locked-in data.

Manual refinement works for a while. But it doesn't scale. You need the system to do the heavy lifting so you can focus on thinking, not formatting.
