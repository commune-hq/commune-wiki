Feeds push. A ledger records. I want the record. Each line shows a small diff, a reason, and a link to the exact note. "Renamed to say the claim." "Added link to bridge topics." "Tightened first sentence." That tone is calm. It lowers the urge to perform. It raises trust.

Readers can skim what moved, then dive into what matters. The ledger also powers [[Auto-essay closes the loop each week]]. The agent clusters the week by topics and momentum and drafts a clean wrap that cites back to notes and ledger lines.

The ledger keeps free users in the loop without a noisy feed. It also shows what changed beyond the gate in [[Three panes deep, then you pay]]. The ledger is the spine of [[I hope people will pay for a working mind]] because it proves recency without tricks.

It pairs with [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] to replace ranking with time and intent. Instead of algorithmic feeds that optimize for engagement, the ledger shows actual work with clear reasons. This supports [[Zen practice protects attention]] by removing the dopamine loops that fragment focus.

The ledger also enables [[Suggestions and Proposals make readers part of the work]] because changes are visible and trackable.
