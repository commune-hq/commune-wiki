I want people to be able to follow what I'm working on without algorithmic feeds or verbose commit logs.

The solution: AI analyzes my git commit history every day. It looks at what notes changed, how they changed, and summarizes what I'm actually working on. "Devon's been refining his thoughts on subscriptions this week" with links to the specific notes.

Not every tiny edit. Not "fixed typo" commits. A smart rollup that tells the story. You can see what themes I'm exploring, what ideas are evolving, what's new.

This runs on [[Commune]] using my home server ([[The Commune box]]). The activity feed shows actual work without the dopamine loops of social feeds. If you want to go deeper into the full changelog, that's behind the paywall.

No algorithms deciding what you see. No tricks to keep you scrolling. Just an intelligent summary of what's happening in my brain.
