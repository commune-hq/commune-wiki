summary: "Readers can suggest fixes or additions. You review and approve. The ledger shows what changed. Turns consumers into contributors."

Most platforms separate creators from readers. You publish, they consume. Maybe they comment. That's it.

[[Commune]] flips this. Readers propose changes. Corrections, additions, new connections. I review, approve or reject. Approved changes update the note and show in [[Ledger replaces feeds]].

Not Wikipedia-style open editing. I control what publishes. But not a one-way broadcast either. Readers who spot gaps or errors contribute directly.

System tracks who suggested what. Attribution matters. Someone adds value, the ledger shows it. [[Build in Public]] becomes collaborative without losing authorship.

Pull requests for thought. Broken link, missing connection, better phrasing. They submit, I decide, wiki gets better.

Engaged readers become collaborators ([[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]]). People who care enough to suggest improvements are exactly who to pay attention to.

Approval workflow protects quality while enabling contribution. Not crowdsourcing authority. Accepting help from people who understand the work well enough to improve it.
