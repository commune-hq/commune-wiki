Most sites are one-way. You write, people read, maybe they leave a comment. That's it.

I want readers to be able to suggest changes. Spot a typo? Broken link? Missing connection? Submit a suggestion. Pull requests for thinking.

I review and decide what gets published. Not Wikipedia-style open editing. I control the output. But readers who care enough to improve things can contribute directly.

Approved changes show up in [[Ledger replaces feeds]] with attribution. Someone helps, the changelog shows it.

This turns engaged readers into collaborators. The people who care enough to suggest improvements are exactly who I want to pay attention to.
