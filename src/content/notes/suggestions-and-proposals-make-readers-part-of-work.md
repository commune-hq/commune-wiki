Most platforms separate creators from readers. You publish, they consume. Maybe they comment. That's it.

Commune flips this. Readers can propose changes—corrections, additions, new connections. You review the proposal, approve or reject. If approved, it updates the note and shows in [[Ledger replaces feeds]].

This isn't Wikipedia-style open editing. You control what publishes. But it also isn't a one-way broadcast. Readers who spot gaps or errors can contribute directly to improving the work.

The system tracks who suggested what. Attribution matters. If someone adds value, the ledger shows it. This connects to [[Build in Public]]—the work becomes collaborative without losing authorship.

Think of it as pull requests for thought. Someone sees a broken link, a missing connection, a better way to phrase an idea. They submit it. You decide. The wiki gets better.

This enables [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]] because engaged readers become collaborators. The people who care enough to suggest improvements are exactly the people worth paying attention to.

The approval workflow protects quality while enabling contribution. You're not crowdsourcing authority—you're accepting help from people who understand the work well enough to improve it.
