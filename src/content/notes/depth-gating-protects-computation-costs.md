summary: AI summaries, RAG search, commit history analysis—these cost money. Gate the compute-heavy features, let free users discover value, charge for depth.

Any computation we do gets depth gated. AI summaries? Gated. RAG search across all notes? Gated. Evolution story of a note from commit diffs? Definitely gated.

The free tier gets you in. You can read [[The Star|starred notes]], browse the wiki, see [[Build in Public|progress]]. But if you want AI to analyze 20 commit diffs and tell you how my thinking evolved on [[Commune]]? That's a subscription.

This isn't about being stingy—it's about sustainability. [[Personal Knowledge Graphs]] with thousands of notes and deep analysis eat large token windows. The [[Commune]] agent needs to remember context about people like Matt and Joel, track projects like [[Awake Happy]] and [[Ads Lab]], understand boundaries between public and private. That gets expensive fast.

The pricing structure makes the [[Commune]] box sell itself to super users. Cloud credits run out, but the box lets you self-host the agent, bring your own keys, configure your own models. You save money and peek behind the curtain. Maybe even modify the agent.

Different mechanisms, same principle:
- Flat rate for basic use
- Hit a credit wall, unblock for $5
- Unlimited compute? Buy the box.

[[Skool]] gates premium features. We gate computation. Same idea—free gets you hooked, paid unlocks the real power. The difference: our power is YOUR thinking made searchable, analyzable, discoverable.

Depth gating makes progress visible, which connects to [[Gamification drives self-discovery]]. You see the value before you pay.
