Longform should be a by-product of work, not a second job. The agent scans the [[Ledger replaces feeds]], clusters the week by topic and momentum, and drafts 700–1,200 words in my voice. I can approve, tighten, or snooze.

The essay cites notes inline. It helps readers who will never pane-surf. It helps me see if the week had a real through-line. If not, next week I plan a sharper arc at [[The Home note should guide the first three steps]]. Essays also surface questions that belong in [[Ask the Brain]].

They expose dead weight. If a section repeats, I make a new note or merge two. The essay turns fragments into a story without breaking the cadence of daily notes. This supports [[Notes beat posts for showing progress]] because the atomic notes remain the primary format.

The weekly synthesis connects to [[Voice in, approvals out]] because the raw material comes from daily voice captures. It enables [[People pay to follow a working mind]] by providing both granular updates and broader narrative context. The approach respects [[Zen practice protects attention]] by automating the synthesis work that would otherwise require dedicated writing sessions.

This process also improves [[Titles are takeaways, not labels]] because unclear titles become obvious when the agent tries to cluster related notes for the weekly narrative.
