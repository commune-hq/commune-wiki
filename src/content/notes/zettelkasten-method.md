summary: "Slip-box system for atomic notes with unique IDs and dense linking. Developed by Niklas Luhmann. Foundation for modern networked note-taking."

Zettelkasten is German for "slip box." Sociologist Niklas Luhmann used it to write 70 books and 400 articles. Each idea goes on one card with a unique ID. Cards link to related cards. The box becomes a conversation partner.

The core insight: notes that reference each other create emergent structure. You don't organize notes into categories. You link them. The connections form the organization.

Key principles:
- One idea per note (atomic)
- Unique identifiers for every note
- Links between related ideas
- No rigid hierarchy
- Dense interconnection

This influenced [[Evergreen Notes]] and most modern note-taking systems. The difference: Luhmann used physical cards. Digital tools enable richer linking and instant retrieval.

The method works because it mirrors how thinking actually happens. Ideas connect associatively, not hierarchically. [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] captures this insight.

Luhmann claimed the Zettelkasten became an independent thinking partner. Writing one note would reveal connections to existing notes, suggesting new directions he hadn't considered. The system contributed ideas, not just storage.

Modern implementations: Obsidian, Roam, [[Andy Matuschak's Notes]], and [[Commune]]. All adapt the core idea: atomic notes, dense links, emergent structure.

The method proves [[Externalizing thought builds a cognitive scaffold for solving complex problems]]. The slip box isn't just memoryâ€”it's infrastructure for thinking.
