Question in. Short answer out. The answer cites notes and versions. It links to the exact anchor you need. It does not invent. If an answer cannot cite, it does not ship.

This feature works only if notes have strong titles. See [[Titles are takeaways, not labels]]. It also depends on clean capture and clear approval. See [[Voice in, approvals out]]. Free search exists for basic lookup. Paid answers save time. They turn the notebook from a reading surface into a learning surface.

Paid answers also reveal weak spots. If the same question shows up, I add a sentence to the note or write a new note. Then the next answer gets sharper. Ask-the-Brain over private daily notes runs local on the [[The Commune box]]. Public Q&A runs on public notes so readers can check sources.

That split keeps privacy intact and still helps people learn fast. This connects to how [[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]] because the system has access to complete context and personal terminology. It supports [[People pay to follow a working mind]] by providing immediate value through instant, cited answers.

The feature also improves through [[Notes beat posts for showing progress]] because atomic notes with clear claims make better retrieval targets than long-form posts.
