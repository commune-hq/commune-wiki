I want to be able to ask questions and get answers from my notes. Not generic AI slop. Real answers with citations.

Ask "How do I think about automation?" and get back an answer that links to the exact notes where I've written about it. No hallucinations. If it can't cite a note, it doesn't answer.

This only works if notes are [[Atomic Notes]] with clear claims. [[AI shapes voice dumps into atomic notes]] needs to create notes that are actually searchable and cite-able.

Private questions run on [[The Commune box]] ([[Private AI outperforms cloud AI]]). Your sensitive questions never leave your server.
