Every note carries a few links in the prose. Each link explains itself. "See [[See what I'm working on]] for why motion beats ranking." "See [[The Commune box]] for the privacy piece." The right rail can show a Related list, but the real work happens inside sentences.

Click Stroll when you want a quiet wander. Shows one related note at a time with a "why" chip. Left. Right. No infinite scroll. Across-notebook discovery is off by default. When you turn it on, it still respects [[Three panes deep, then you pay]].

Library energy. You walk the stacks with a thread in hand. Pairs well with [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]]. When someone you follow Collects two notes together, that co-collection becomes a strong "why" for Related. The system stays legible. You always know why you're seeing a link.

[[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] provides serendipity without algorithmic manipulation. [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] lets conceptual relationships emerge naturally through use patterns.

Discovery feels intentional, not compulsive. The browsing experience creates natural pathways through someone's thinking process, which makes [[I hope people will pay for a working mind]] more likely.
