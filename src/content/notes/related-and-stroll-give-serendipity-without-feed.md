Every note carries a few links in the prose. Each link explains itself. "See [[Ledger replaces feeds]] for why motion beats ranking." "See [[The Commune box]] for the privacy piece." The right rail can show a Related list, but the real work happens inside sentences.

Click Stroll when you want a quiet wander. It shows one related note at a time with the "why" chip. Left. Right. No infinite scroll. Across-notebook discovery is off by default. When you turn it on, it still respects [[Three panes deep, then you pay]].

This is library energy. You walk the stacks with a thread in hand. This pairs well with [[Follow and Collect keep signal, not hype]]. When someone you like Collects two notes together, that co-collection becomes a strong "why" for Related. The system stays legible. You always know why you are seeing a link.

The approach supports [[Discovery runs on time, follows, and why]] by providing serendipity without algorithmic manipulation. It enables [[Associative linking over hierarchies]] by letting conceptual relationships emerge naturally through use patterns.

This connects to [[Zen practice protects attention]] because discovery feels intentional rather than compulsive. The browsing experience supports [[People pay to follow a working mind]] by creating natural pathways through someone's thinking process.
