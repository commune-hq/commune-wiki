summary: "Static vs dynamic architecture research for digital gardens. Astro 40% faster for content-first sites. Hybrid recommended: Astro wiki + Next.js agent dashboard."

Analyzed tech stack decisions from Obsidian, Reflect, Roam, and digital garden frameworks to answer: static (Astro) or dynamic (Next.js) for [[Commune]]? The answer: both.

## Key Findings

**Astro wins for wikis**: 40% faster page loads, 90% less JavaScript than Next.js for content-heavy sites. Islands architecture gives zero-JS by default, hydrates only interactive components (graph, search).

**Next.js for dynamic features**: ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) perfect for agent dashboard, proposals, real-time updates. But heavier payload, more complexity.

**Hybrid recommended**: Keep [[Commune]] public wiki on Astro (SEO, speed). Add Next.js app for agent UI (dynamic). Share components via npm package. Best of both worlds.

## What We Researched

Performance benchmarks, framework comparisons, digital garden implementations from 2024-2025. Drew from Astro docs, Next.js ISR patterns, Obsidian/Reflect architecture decisions.

## Recommendations

**Public wiki stays Astro**: Content-first sites benefit most from static-first approach. Perfect for SEO, Core Web Vitals, and pane-based navigation.

**Agent dashboard in Next.js**: Real-time proposals, multi-day workflows, auth, dynamic state. Next.js App Router with ISR handles this better than static.

**Shared component library**: @commune/ui published to npm. Both Astro wiki and Next.js agent import same components. DRY code, consistent UX.
