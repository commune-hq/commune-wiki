summary: "2024-2025 sentiment analysis on creator platform pricing. Key finding: creators hate hidden fees and revenue share at scale. $9 entry + 0% fees at $49 wins."
---

I analyzed how [[Substack]], [[Skool]], Patreon, Gumroad, and Ghost price their platforms. The question was simple. How should [[Commune]] price to actually win creator trust instead of extracting maximum revenue upfront.

Hidden fees hurt more than anything. [[Substack]] advertises a 10% fee but it's actually 16% total when you add platform, Stripe, currency conversion, and payout fees. Creators feel deceived when the math doesn't match the marketing. Transparency wins even if your percentage is slightly higher but honest.

Revenue share at scale is where the pain gets real. [[Substack]] taking $1,600 per month when you hit $10K revenue feels exploitative. Creators start preferring flat monthly fees once they scale. Ghost charges $49 monthly with 0% platform fees. At $10K creator revenue, Ghost saves you $1,200 per month compared to [[Substack]]. That's huge.

[[Skool]] added a $9 tier after only having $99. They called it democratization. But they gate custom domains behind the higher tier. That's an opportunity. If [[Commune]] offers custom domains at the $9 tier, we beat [[Skool]] on value right away.

I pulled from 60+ sources including creator tweets, Reddit threads, and platform announcements from the past 18 months. The sentiment shift in 2024-2025 is clear. Creators want fair economics, not platform extraction.

Four-tier strategy makes sense. Free self-hosted to prove value. $9 cloud with custom domain to beat [[Skool]]. $49 pro with 0% platform fees to beat [[Substack]]. $299+ for [[The Commune box]] as premium hardware option.

Show total cost upfront. Platform fee plus Stripe, all visible. Stripe built trust by being clear about their fees. Copy that approach.

0% fees at $49 is the killer feature. Ghost proved this works. When creators make $10K monthly, saving $1,200 in platform fees makes the choice obvious.
