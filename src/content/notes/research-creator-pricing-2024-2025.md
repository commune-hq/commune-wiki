summary: "2024-2025 sentiment analysis on creator platform pricing. Key finding: creators hate hidden fees and revenue share at scale. $9 entry + 0% fees at $49 wins."
---

Analyzed [[Substack]], [[Skool]], Patreon, Gumroad, Ghost pricing models to understand what creators actually want in 2024-2025. The question: how should [[Commune]] price to win creator trust?

**Hidden fees hurt**: [[Substack]] advertises "10% fee" but actually 16% total (platform + Stripe + currency + payout fees). Creators feel deceived. Transparency wins.

**Revenue share at scale**: [[Substack]] taking $1,600/month on $10K revenue hurts. Creators prefer flat monthly fee at scale (Ghost $49 with 0% fees vs [[Substack]] 10%).

**$9 entry tier**: [[Skool]] added $9 tier (was only $99) for democratization. But gates custom domain. Opportunity: offer custom domain at $9 tier (beats [[Skool]]).

Researched 60+ sources including creator tweets, Reddit discussions, platform announcements from 2024-2025. Focused on sentiment shifts and pricing changes in last 18 months.

**Four-tier strategy**: Free self-hosted → $9 cloud (custom domain) → $49 pro (0% platform fees) → $299+ box. Undercuts [[Substack]] and [[Skool]] while offering better economics.

**Radical transparency**: Show total cost upfront (platform + Stripe), no hidden fees. Stripe wins on trust by being clear about fees.

**0% fees at $49**: Ghost charges $49/month but 0% on creator revenue. At $10K/month creator revenue, Ghost saves creators $1,200/month vs [[Substack]]. This wins at scale.
