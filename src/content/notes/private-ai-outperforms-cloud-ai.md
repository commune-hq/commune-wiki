summary: "AI running on your hardware with access to all your data beats cloud models trained on generic internet content. Context wins."

Cloud AI is trained on generic internet data. It doesn't know your projects, your terminology, your relationships, or your accumulated decisions. That's the ceiling.

Private AI running at home has access to everything. Complete conversation history across all contexts. Your wiki with your specific language. Communication patterns with specific people. Projects spanning months or years. That's why [[Box-first earns trust]] matters.

The agent can answer questions cloud models can't. What did Sarah and I decide about the Q4 launch? Show me all mentions of the pricing strategy from last month. Draft a follow-up in the style I used with this client before.

Context beats raw intelligence. A smaller model with full access to your data outperforms a larger model without it. That's why [[Voice in, approvals out]] works. The system learns your voice over time.

Your data never leaves your infrastructure. No trust boundary with cloud providers. [[Owning data infrastructure eliminates middleware]] gives you this advantage. [[Integrated data analysis unlocks impossible observations]] becomes possible when everything connects. [[Local-First Software]] plus local AI changes the game.
