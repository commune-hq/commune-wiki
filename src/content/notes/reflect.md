<a href="https://reflect.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="white-space:nowrap">Reflect<span class="external-link-icon" aria-hidden="true">â†—</span></a> is a note-taking app with end-to-end encryption, daily notes, backlinks, and AI integration. Clean interface. Fast. Simple. Apple only. Mac and iOS.

I used it for years after failing to use [[Obsidian]] before I decided to build [[Commune]]. I actually invested when they did a friends and family round. The app is awesome.

The limitation I hit is because it's end-to-end encrypted on their servers. I would have to download my data every time I want to run automations. Once LLMs became really prevalent and agents like [[Cursor]] and Claude Code came into the scene, it shifted my mindset as to what's possible. Specifically [[Cursor]].

The way I used Reflect was simply dumping on the daily note and trying to cross-link things. [[Manual note refinement doesn't scale]] when you can't automate the workflow.

Reflect is great for individuals who want simple, encrypted notes. But if you want to build agents, run automations, or create custom workflows on top of your thinking, you need [[The Commune box]].
