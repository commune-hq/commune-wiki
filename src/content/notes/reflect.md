<a href="https://reflect.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="white-space:nowrap">Reflect<span class="external-link-icon" aria-hidden="true">â†—</span></a> is a note-taking app with end-to-end encryption, daily notes, backlinks, and AI integration. Clean interface. Fast. Simple.

I used it for years before building [[Commune]]. The app is solid. But the encryption means you can't easily get your data out or run automations on it. You'd have to download exports daily to do anything programmatic.

That limitation showed me what [[Commune]] needed to be. [[Manual note refinement doesn't scale]] when you can't automate the workflow. [[Owning your data infrastructure eliminates the need for specialized middleware and roles]] because you control the entire stack.

Reflect is great for individuals who want simple, encrypted notes. But if you want to build agents, run automations, or create custom workflows on top of your thinking, you need [[The Commune box]].
