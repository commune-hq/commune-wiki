Most knowledge workers spend 20-30% of their time organizing, searching, and managing files instead of creating value. This is a fundamental misallocation of cognitive resources.

The problem isn't that people are bad at organization—it's that **manual organization doesn't scale** with information volume. Every document requires multiple decisions: What folder? What name? What tags? These micro-decisions accumulate into significant cognitive overhead.

Traditional solutions (better folder structures, naming conventions, tagging systems) treat symptoms, not the root cause. They still require humans to make classification decisions for every piece of information.

The solution is [[Intelligent router eliminates project management]] through automated classification. When AI can understand content and context, it can handle the organizational decisions that currently drain human attention.

This connects to [[Externalizing thought builds cognitive scaffold]] because proper automation frees mental resources for higher-order thinking. Instead of managing information, we can focus on synthesizing insights and making connections.

The goal isn't perfect organization—it's **zero-friction capture** with intelligent routing. Capture first, let systems handle the rest.
