summary: "Making your learning visible creates feedback loops. People correct mistakes, suggest resources, open opportunities."

Learning in private means slow feedback. You discover mistakes eventually, but only after they've compounded. Learning in public means immediate course correction from people who know better.

The mechanism: you share incomplete thoughts, half-formed ideas, work in progress. People respond. Some correct errors. Some suggest resources you didn't know existed. Some connect you to opportunities.

This accelerates growth because you're not just learning from your experience—you're learning from everyone watching. The audience becomes part of the education.

The fear: looking stupid. The reality: everyone respects the person willing to be wrong publicly. It signals confidence and growth mindset. Pretending you know everything signals insecurity.

This connects to [[Build in Public]]. Same principle, different context. Making work visible attracts help, feedback, and collaboration. Hiding work means solving every problem alone.

[[Commune]] enables this with [[Evergreen Notes]]. Notes evolve over time. Early versions are rough. Later versions incorporate feedback and new understanding. The [[Ledger replaces feeds]] shows the evolution.

The compounding effect is real. Public learners build networks of people invested in their growth. Private learners stay isolated. Over time, the gap widens dramatically.

Practical approach: share what you're learning weekly. Don't wait for expertise. Document the journey. The people who benefit most are the ones a few steps behind you.

This is why [[Transparent decision-making builds trust]]. Showing your thinking—including mistakes and corrections—demonstrates authenticity. Polished outputs hide the real work.
