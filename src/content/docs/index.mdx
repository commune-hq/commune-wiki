## What is Commune?

Commune is a **local-first personal AI infrastructure** that runs on your own hardware. No cloud rent-seeking. Complete data ownership. Perpetual knowledge that compounds over time.

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="🔒 Private by Default" icon="lock">
		Your data never leaves your server unless you explicitly publish it. On-device transcription, local models, Git-based knowledge bases.
	</Card>
	<Card title="🏠 Runs at Home" icon="home">
		$300-$800 mini-PC replaces multiple cloud subscriptions. Your AI, your rules, your timeline.
	</Card>

		Multi-entity knowledge bases (personal, business, technical) with intelligent cross-referencing.
	</Card>
