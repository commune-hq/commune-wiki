## What is Commune?

Commune is a **local-first personal AI infrastructure** designed to run on a home server. It's built around these core principles:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="🏠 Local-First" icon="laptop">
    Your data stays on hardware you control. No cloud dependencies, no vendor lock-in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📝 Git-Driven" icon="document">
    All knowledge stored as Markdown in Git repositories. Version controlled, portable, and future-proof.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔒 Privacy by Default" icon="lock">
    Private by design. Explicit opt-in required to make anything public.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🤖 Human-in-the-Loop" icon="approve-check">
    AI agents propose changes; humans approve. Never fully autonomous.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Key Features

- **Multi-Entity Knowledge Bases**: Separate Git repos for personal, business, and research notes
- **Mobile-First Capture**: iOS app for fast voice/text capture with offline support
- **Agentic Workflows**: AI agents plan, propose, and stage changes with human approval gates
- **Build in Public**: This wiki is auto-generated from our private knowledge base

## Current Status

**Phase 3.3**: iOS DesignSystem complete  
**Phase 4**: Public wiki infrastructure (you're looking at it!)

**Building in public** means this documentation reflects our actual development process, including experiments, pivots, and lessons learned. It's messy, honest, and evolving.
