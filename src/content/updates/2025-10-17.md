Improved SEO and fixed date display bugs across the site.

## What Changed

**Google Rich Results** - Added Article schema with image, breadcrumbs, and full metadata for better search visibility. Google can now display rich cards with images when indexing notes.

**Date display fix** - Fixed timezone issue where dates appeared as "yesterday" when they should show "today". Affected homepage (index.astro) and all note pages. Now calculates relative dates client-side in local timezone.

## Technical Details

Schema.org Article type with BreadcrumbList navigation for proper SEO structure. Client-side JavaScript recalculates dates to avoid server/build-time timezone mismatches (dates were being parsed in UTC then displayed in PST, causing off-by-one day errors).
