Completed 4 parallel deep research sprints (40K+ words total) to inform blocking strategic decisions before continuing development.

## What Was Added

**Research reports** - Created full research pages at /research/* with summaries at /notes/research-*:
- [[Deep Research: OSS Business Models]] (37K words)
- [[Deep Research: Creator Platform Pricing]] (32K words)
- [[Deep Research: Digital Garden Tech Stacks]] (32K words)
- [[Deep Research: Hardware Ecosystems]] (54K words)

**Cross-collection wikilinks** - Implemented full linking between atomic notes and research pages with hover previews, stars, and search integration.

**Strategic decisions** - Added 6 blocking decision issues (#29-#34) based on research findings.

**Content fixes** - Rewrote [[The Commune box]] note in first-person atomic style. Fixed relative dates in dynamically loaded panes.

## Why This Matters

Matt (co-founder) is ready to join but current architecture doesn't scale. Agent pipeline must be prioritized (can't launch without it). Multi-tenant structure needed immediately, not Phase 4.

Research provides clear recommendations: Obsidian model (free app + paid services), hybrid architecture (Astro wiki + Next.js agent dashboard), 4-tier pricing ($0 → $9 → $49 → $299+), software-first with hardware optional.
