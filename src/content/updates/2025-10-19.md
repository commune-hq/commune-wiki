Rewrote all 4 deep research summary notes in first person voice to match [[My Working Notes]] style.

## What Changed

**Research summaries** - Changed from formal third person to conversational first person. "I looked at", "I studied" instead of "Analyzed" and "Researched". Matches voice from [[Commune]] and [[Build in Public]].

**Mobile fixes** - Fixed hover preview z-index (was behind search modal). Title sizes now consistent at 30px on mobile between summary notes and research pages.

**Table scroll** - Added horizontal scroll for tables on mobile so they never exceed content width.

## Notes Updated

- [[Deep Research: OSS Business Models]]
- [[Deep Research: Creator Platform Pricing]]
- [[Deep Research: Digital Garden Tech Stacks]]
- [[Deep Research: Hardware Ecosystems]]
