# Creator Platform Pricing Research 2024-2025

## Executive Summary

The creator platform landscape in 2024-2025 is experiencing significant pricing evolution driven by three key forces:

1. **Platform consolidation toward 10% standard fees** (Patreon, Substack, Gumroad)
2. **Democratization through low-barrier entry tiers** (Skool's $9 plan, beehiiv's free tier)
3. **Growing creator backlash against platform lock-in and hidden fees**

Key insight: Creators increasingly value **transparency, portability, and ownership** over feature richness. The most successful platforms balance accessibility (low entry barrier) with sustainable economics (clear upgrade path).


## 1. Pricing Model Comparison Table

| Platform | Entry Tier | Mid Tier | Pro Tier | Transaction Fees | Custom Domain | Key Restrictions |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Skool** | $9/mo Hobby | — | $99/mo Pro | Hobby: 10%<br>Pro: 2.9% | Hobby: No<br>Pro: Yes | Hobby: 1 admin, no custom URL |
| **Substack** | Free | — | — | 10% + Stripe (2.9% + $0.30) | $50 one-time fee | Total ~16% in fees, Apple IAP forces 30% markup |
| **Patreon** | 5% (legacy) | — | 10% (new creators post-Aug 2025) | 2.9% + $0.30 | Link only (not full custom) | Hidden payout fees, currency conversion 2.5% |
| **Gumroad** | Free | — | — | 10% flat (changed from tiered 2.9%-7%) | No native support | Creators angry about 2022 fee hike (was 2.9%-7% tiered) |
| **Ghost** | $11/mo (500 subs) | $34/mo | $199/mo | 0% (direct Stripe) | Yes (all tiers) | Self-hosted complexity, higher monthly cost |
| **ConvertKit (Kit)** | Free (1K subs) | $25/mo Creator | $59/mo Pro | 3.5% on newsletters + 0.6% on commerce | Yes (free tier!) | Revenue sharing on paid newsletters |
| **beehiiv** | Free (2.5K subs) | $39/mo Scale | — | 0% (direct Stripe, 3% total) | Yes (free tier!) | Pricing increased April 2024, now subscriber-based |
| **Circle** | $39-49/mo | $99/mo Professional | $219/mo Business | Via Stripe (3%) | Yes | No transaction fees, but higher monthly costs |
| **Mighty Networks** | $23-49/mo Community | $99-119/mo Business | $99+/mo Mighty Pro | Via Stripe (3%) | Yes | Better annual discounts than Circle |


## 2. Platform-by-Platform Sentiment Analysis

### Skool: ★★★★☆ (Positive with caveats)

**Positive Sentiment:**
- "The $9 Hobby Plan democratizes community building" — multiple review sites
- 2-3x higher engagement than Circle/Mighty Networks due to gamification
- Alex Hormozi backing (Skool Games competition) drives credibility
- "Skool is the new Patreon but better" — Medium creator

**Negative Sentiment:**
- "MLM-like" due to course-selling focus and Skool Games hype
- Gamification is "shallow once novelty wears off" — only rewards public likes
- No custom URL on $9 tier frustrates brand-conscious creators
- 10% transaction fee on Hobby plan stings at scale

**Why It's Winning:**
- Clear upgrade economics: breakeven at $1,200 MRR (Hobby → Pro makes sense)
- All-in-one simplicity: community + courses + gamification in one UX
- Network effects: Skool Games creates discoverability moat

**Quote**: "For the price of a McDonald's meal, you get 90% of the platform" — Skool marketing


### Substack: ★★★☆☆ (Mixed — simplicity vs. scaling costs)

**Positive Sentiment:**
- "Best for writers who just want to write" — no tech complexity
- Strong network effects via Substack Recommendations
- Free to start, good for testing newsletter ideas

**Negative Sentiment:**
- **Total fees sting at scale**: 10% platform + 2.9% Stripe + $0.30 = ~16% effective rate
- "Substack steals your audience and revenue" — creator blog post
- **Apple IAP controversy (2025)**: iOS prices inflated 30%, creators wait 45 days for payment
- **Exit friction**: Substack keeps taking 10% even after you export subscribers
- "Substack just killed the creator economy" — Big Desk Energy newsletter

**Why Creators Leave:**
- Once crossing $1,000/mo, 16% fees feel expensive vs. self-hosted alternatives
- Ghost, beehiiv, or Kit save money at scale (0-4% total fees)

**Quote**: "Revenue sharing stings once you cross $1,000 a month" — SchoolMaker review


### Patreon: ★★★☆☆ (Declining — fee hikes + hidden costs)

**Positive Sentiment:**
- Legacy creators (pre-Aug 2025) keep 8% Pro plan pricing
- Good for fan-based content creators (podcasters, YouTubers, artists)
- Simple tier-based membership setup

**Negative Sentiment:**
- **August 2025 price hike**: New creators now pay 10% (up from 8% Pro tier)
- **Hidden fees epidemic**: "Patreon's fee structure feels cloak-and-dagger"
  - Platform fee (10%) + Stripe (2.9% + $0.30) + currency conversion (2.5%) + payout fees
- **Apple IAP backlash**: Creators had "no say" in 30% iOS markup decision
- "High fees, low engagement" compared to Skool — Reddit sentiment

**Why It's Losing Ground:**
- Skool offers better community engagement for same/lower fees
- No gamification or course features vs. competitors
- Platform lock-in without custom domain ownership

**Quote**: "Creators are understandably unhappy and threatening to leave" — Patreon IAP announcement


### Gumroad: ★★☆☆☆ (Negative — fee hike backlash)

**Positive Sentiment:**
- Simple digital product sales (eBooks, courses, templates)
- No monthly fees, pay-as-you-go model

**Negative Sentiment:**
- **2022 fee hike crisis**: 2.9%-7% tiered → 10% flat overnight
- "Creators felt angry and frustrated" — many re-evaluated options
- High earners hit hardest (some went from 2.9% → 10%)
- Poor communication around pricing change

**Why It Changed:**
- Sahil Lavingia: "Monthly net income too low, need to match Substack/Patreon at 10%"
- Previous tiered model (lower fees for high earners) was unsustainable

**Impact:**
- Indie Hackers community discussion shows migration to Paddle, Lemon Squeezy
- Flat 10% now industry standard, but trust damage remains

**Quote**: "Gumroad raised fees to be in line with Substack and Patreon at 10%" — Sahil Lavingia


### Ghost: ★★★★☆ (Strong for developers, niche for others)

**Positive Sentiment:**
- **0% platform fees** — creators keep 100% (minus Stripe 3%)
- Full data ownership, open-source, self-hosted option
- Custom domain on all tiers
- "Independent alternative to ConvertKit with 0% fees" — Ghost marketing

**Negative Sentiment:**
- Higher technical barrier (requires hosting knowledge)
- Monthly costs scale steeply ($11 → $34 → $199)
- Custom sending domain only on Business tier ($199/mo)

**Why Creators Choose It:**
- Developers and tech-savvy creators prioritize ownership
- Long-term cost savings at scale (no revenue share)
- Full control over design, data, integrations

**Quote**: "Ghost lets you own your audience without platform tax" — creator testimonial


### ConvertKit (Kit): ★★★★☆ (Strong for email-first creators)

**Positive Sentiment:**
- Free tier includes custom domain (rare!)
- Strong email automation and segmentation
- Transparent pricing, no hidden fees
- 3.5% on paid newsletters is lower than Substack's 10%

**Negative Sentiment:**
- Pricing scales with subscribers (can get expensive)
- 0.6% fee on commerce + 3.5% on newsletters adds up
- Less focus on community vs. Skool/Circle

**Why It Competes:**
- Email-first creators prefer it over Substack for cost savings
- Better creator control than Patreon (export, automation)


### beehiiv: ★★★★☆ (Rising star — best for newsletters)

**Positive Sentiment:**
- **Free tier with custom domain** (competitive advantage)
- **0% platform fees** (just Stripe 3%)
- Strong ad network: Creators earning $940+ with 1K subscribers
- Trustpilot 4/5 stars, 70%+ reviews are 5-star
- 15.6 billion emails sent in 2024 (up from 4.5B in 2023)

**Negative Sentiment:**
- April 2024 pricing increase (moved to subscriber-based like ConvertKit)
- Less feature-rich than all-in-one platforms (no courses, community)

**Why It's Growing:**
- Best newsletter-specific features (ad network, referral program, analytics)
- Monetization tools help creators earn without charging subscribers
- Cost-effective alternative to Substack

**Quote**: "Most affordably priced option, though price increase in 2024 narrowed the gap" — review


## 3. Trend Analysis: Where Is Pricing Headed?

### Trend #1: 10% Platform Fee Standardization

**Evidence:**
- Gumroad: Moved to 10% flat (2022)
- Patreon: New creators pay 10% (Aug 2025)
- Substack: Always 10%
- Skool: 10% on Hobby tier, 2.9% on Pro

**Interpretation:**
The industry is converging on **10% as the "platform sustainability threshold"**. Platforms tried lower fees (Patreon's 5%, Gumroad's tiered 2.9%-7%) but couldn't maintain operations.

**Counter-Trend:**
Self-hosted platforms (Ghost, beehiiv, Kit) offer 0% platform fees to differentiate, but charge monthly SaaS fees instead.


### Trend #2: Low-Barrier Entry + Premium Upsell

**Evidence:**
- Skool: $9 Hobby → $99 Pro at $1,200 MRR breakeven
- beehiiv: Free Launch → $39 Scale at 2,500 subscribers
- ConvertKit: Free (1K subs) → $25+ Creator
- Ghost: $11 (500 subs) → $199 (large scale)

**Strategy:**
Platforms are **democratizing access** to capture early-stage creators, then monetizing via:
1. Higher fees on low tiers (Skool Hobby 10% vs. Pro 2.9%)
2. Subscriber-based scaling (beehiiv, Kit, Ghost)
3. Feature gates (custom domain, admin seats, integrations)

**Why It Works:**
- Creators start free/cheap, build audience, then upgrade when economics justify
- Platform captures lifetime value as creator grows
- Reduces churn (creators "grow into" the platform)


### Trend #3: Percentage vs. Flat Fee Hybrid Models

**Evidence:**
- Brand-creator partnerships: 10 flat fee deals for every 1 affiliate deal
- Flat fee + commission pays 25% less ($1,700 vs. $2,300)
- 70%+ of full-time creators earn <$49K annually (flat fees don't scale)

**Shift:**
Platforms are experimenting with **hybrid models**:
- Base flat fee (predictable) + performance bonus (upside)
- Monthly SaaS (infrastructure cost) + transaction fee (revenue share)

**Problem:**
Pure percentage models don't work for niche creators. "Being a niche creator churning out content for solely affiliate commissions is not sustainable."


### Trend #4: Self-Hosted vs. Platform-Hosted Tension

**Evidence:**
- 93% of creators say platform dependency has **negative impact** on their lives
- 99% of creators say **control over content is crucial**
- "Creators are tired of battling algorithms and being at mercy of app updates"
- 83% wanted **multiple revenue streams** (not just platform-dependent)

**Shift:**
Creators moving to:
1. **Email-first strategies** (off-platform communication)
2. **Self-hosted communities** (Ghost, WordPress + plugins)
3. **Blockchain alternatives** (true content/audience ownership)

**Platform Response:**
- Platforms adding data portability (Substack CSV export)
- Custom domain options (beehiiv free tier, Kit free tier)
- Direct Stripe integration (Ghost, beehiiv) so creators "own" payment relationship

**Quote**: "Platform lock-in is incredibly dangerous for writers — it strips away data and control" — creator blog


### Trend #5: Fee Transparency Backlash

**Evidence:**
- Patreon: "Hidden fees are a common complaint"
- Substack: Total 16% fees often surprise creators (10% + Stripe 2.9% + $0.30)
- Gumroad: Poor communication on 10% hike caused trust crisis
- Payment processing: $187B paid in fees in 2024 (US businesses)

**Creator Demand:**
- Stripe praised for "transparent, flat-rate pricing" and "dashboards showing fee breakdown"
- Platforms with "no hidden fees" (Ghost, beehiiv) win trust
- Creators want to know: Platform fee + Stripe fee + currency conversion + payout fees **upfront**

**Best Practice:**
beehiiv, Ghost, Circle show **total cost** (e.g., "3% Stripe, 0% platform") vs. hiding Stripe fees in fine print.


## 4. Creator Pain Points by Platform

### Universal Pain Points (Cross-Platform)

1. **Hidden Fees Epidemic**
   - Platform advertises "10% fee" but total cost is 15-18% after Stripe, currency conversion, payout fees
   - Creators want single, transparent number

2. **Platform Lock-In**
   - Can't easily migrate audience without losing platform features
   - Substack keeps taking 10% even after export
   - Custom domains often restricted to higher tiers

3. **Apple IAP Tax**
   - 30% markup on iOS purchases (Patreon, Substack)
   - 45-day payment delays (Apple to platform to creator)
   - Creators had "no say" in decision

4. **Scaling Economics**
   - Percentage fees punish success (10% of $10K/mo = $1K/mo to platform)
   - Monthly SaaS fees can be cheaper at scale (Ghost $199/mo vs. Substack $1K/mo in fees)

5. **Algorithm Dependency**
   - Platform discovery helps early, but creators want direct audience access
   - Email/custom domain increasingly seen as "de-risking" strategy

## 6. Recommendations for Commune Pricing Strategy

Based on this research, here are strategic recommendations for Commune:

### Core Pricing Philosophy

**Recommendation**: Hybrid model with **low-barrier entry + transparent scaling economics**

**Rationale**:
- Skool's $9 Hobby tier proves demand for accessible entry points
- beehiiv/Kit show free tiers with custom domains build trust
- Ghost demonstrates 0% platform fees can be competitive differentiator
- Substack/Patreon show percentage-only models create scaling friction


### Proposed Commune Pricing Tiers

#### Tier 1: "Garden" (Free)
- **Target**: Hobbyists, explorers, personal knowledge management
- **Features**:
  - Unlimited notes, unlimited backlinks
  - Basic community features (read-only on others' gardens)
  - Commune subdomain (`username.commune.garden`)
  - Export anytime (full data portability)
- **Transaction Fee**: N/A (no monetization features)
- **Custom Domain**: No

**Strategic Goal**: Massive user acquisition, build network effects, prove value before asking for payment


#### Tier 2: "Village" ($9-15/mo)
- **Target**: Early-stage creators, niche communities, side projects
- **Features**:
  - Everything in Garden
  - Paid memberships (charge for access)
  - Community moderation tools
  - Basic analytics
  - Email notifications
- **Transaction Fee**: 8-10% (competitive with Patreon/Substack, better than Skool Hobby)
- **Custom Domain**: **YES** (key differentiator — beehiiv/Kit do this, Skool doesn't)

**Strategic Goal**: Convert free users to paid, capture creators before $1K MRR threshold


#### Tier 3: "City" ($49-99/mo)
- **Target**: Established creators, $1K-10K MRR, serious communities
- **Features**:
  - Everything in Village
  - **2.9% transaction fee** (Stripe passthrough, 0% platform fee)
  - Advanced analytics & insights
  - Multiple admins/moderators
  - API access for integrations
  - White-label options
  - Priority support
- **Transaction Fee**: 2.9% (just Stripe, **0% Commune fee**)
- **Custom Domain**: Yes + custom sending domain

**Strategic Goal**: Retain scaling creators with economics that beat all competitors at scale

**Breakeven Analysis**:
- Village (10% fee): $9/mo + 10% of revenue
- City (0% fee): $99/mo + 2.9% of revenue
- Breakeven: ~$1,500 MRR (similar to Skool's $1,200 threshold)


#### Tier 4: "Metropolis" (Custom/Enterprise)
- **Target**: Large communities, courses, enterprises
- **Features**:
  - Everything in City
  - Dedicated support
  - Custom integrations
  - SLA guarantees
  - Self-hosted option (data ownership)
- **Pricing**: Custom (likely $200-500+/mo)
- **Transaction Fee**: 0-2.9% (negotiable)


### Differentiation Strategy

#### 1. **Radical Fee Transparency**
- Show total cost upfront: "Village: $9/mo + 10% fee + 2.9% Stripe = ~13% total"
- No hidden payout fees, currency conversion fees, or surprise charges
- Fee calculator on pricing page (like AiyaHub fee comparison tool)

**Why**: Patreon/Substack lose trust from hidden fees. Stripe wins trust with transparency.


#### 2. **Custom Domain on Paid Tiers**
- Village ($9-15) includes custom domain
- City includes custom domain + custom sending domain

**Why**:
- Skool Hobby ($9) doesn't offer this — major pain point
- beehiiv/Kit prove it's possible on free/low tiers
- Creators value brand ownership


#### 3. **0% Platform Fee at Scale**
- City tier (and above) charges **0% Commune fee**, just Stripe 2.9%

**Why**:
- Ghost's differentiator is 0% fees
- Percentage fees punish successful creators ($10K MRR = $1K/mo to platform)
- SaaS monthly fee aligns incentives better (Commune wins when creator succeeds, not by taxing revenue)


#### 4. **Data Portability Guarantee**
- Export full data (notes, backlinks, members, emails) anytime
- Import from Notion, Obsidian, Roam, Logseq (reduce switching cost)
- No "Commune keeps taking fees after you leave" like Substack

**Why**:
- Platform lock-in is #1 creator complaint
- 99% of creators say control is crucial
- Trust-building differentiator


#### 5. **Gamification + Knowledge Graph**
- Skool proves gamification drives engagement
- Commune's unique angle: **Gamify knowledge quality, not just likes**
  - Award points for creating high-quality backlinks
  - Reward depth (evergreen notes) not just activity
  - Leaderboards for "most connected gardens" (knowledge graph density)

**Why**:
- Skool's gamification is "shallow" (just likes)
- Commune can reward intellectual rigor, synthesis, original thinking
- Aligns with "tools for thought" positioning


#### 6. **Network Effects via Public Gardens**
- Free tier users contribute to public knowledge graph
- Paid users can "fork" public notes into private gardens
- Discovery engine shows related thinkers (like Substack recommendations)

**Why**:
- Substack's network effects come from recommendations
- Skool's come from Skool Games competition
- Commune's should come from **idea cross-pollination**


### Pricing Messaging Examples

**Homepage Hero**:
> "Start free. Own your knowledge. Grow without platform tax."

**Pricing Page Tagline**:
> "Village: $9/mo for early creators. City: 0% platform fee when you scale. Always own your data."

**Fee Transparency Section**:
> "Village Total Cost: $9/mo + 10% on revenue + Stripe 2.9% = ~13% all-in. No hidden fees. Ever."

**Comparison Table**:
| Platform | Entry Cost | At $1K MRR | At $10K MRR | Custom Domain (Low Tier) | Data Export |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Commune Village | $9/mo | $139/mo (13%) | $1,309/mo (13%) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Full export |
| Commune City | $99/mo | $128/mo (2.9% Stripe) | $389/mo (2.9% Stripe) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Full export |
| Skool Hobby | $9/mo | $139/mo (13%) | $1,309/mo (13%) | ❌ No | ⚠️ Limited |
| Skool Pro | $99/mo | $128/mo (2.9%) | $389/mo (2.9%) | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Limited |
| Substack | Free | $160/mo (16%) | $1,600/mo (16%) | ⚠️ $50 fee | ⚠️ Keeps 10% after export |
| Patreon | Free | $130/mo (13%) | $1,300/mo (13%) | ❌ Link only | ⚠️ Limited |
| Ghost | $11/mo | $41/mo (3% Stripe) | $389/mo (3% Stripe) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Full export |

**Key Insight**: Commune City beats all competitors at $10K MRR+ (only Ghost matches on fees, but Commune adds gamification + knowledge graph)


### Risks & Mitigations

#### Risk 1: 0% Platform Fee Isn't Sustainable
**Mitigation**:
- City tier at $99/mo covers infrastructure costs (like Ghost)
- High-value creators ($10K+ MRR) anchor revenue with flat SaaS fees
- Metropolis tier (enterprise) provides margin

#### Risk 2: Free Tier Creates Deadweight Users
**Mitigation**:
- Free tier has no monetization features (can't charge members)
- Free users add value via public knowledge graph (content moat)
- Clear upgrade path to Village when they want to monetize

#### Risk 3: $9 Village Tier Cannibalizes City Tier
**Mitigation**:
- Clear breakeven at $1,500 MRR (like Skool's $1,200)
- In-app prompts: "You're paying $150/mo in fees. Save $51/mo by upgrading to City."
- No multi-admin on Village (teams forced to City tier)

#### Risk 4: Custom Domain on $9 Tier Is Expensive
**Mitigation**:
- Custom domain setup is one-time work (DNS), minimal ongoing cost
- beehiiv and Kit prove it's feasible
- Differentiator worth the CAC investment


## 7. Competitive Positioning Summary

### Where Commune Wins

| Dimension | Commune Advantage | Competitor Weakness |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Fee Transparency** | Show total cost upfront (platform + Stripe) | Substack/Patreon hide Stripe fees in fine print |
| **Scaling Economics** | 0% platform fee at City tier ($99/mo) | Substack/Patreon charge 10% forever |
| **Custom Domain Access** | Village tier ($9) includes custom domain | Skool Hobby ($9) doesn't, Substack charges $50 |
| **Data Portability** | Full export, no exit fees | Substack keeps 10% after export |
| **Gamification Depth** | Reward knowledge quality (backlinks, synthesis) | Skool only rewards likes (shallow) |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Unique positioning (tools for thought + community) | Skool/Patreon/Substack = generic content platforms |


### Where Commune Faces Challenges

| Dimension | Competitor Advantage | Commune Gap |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Network Effects (Discovery)** | Substack Recommendations, Skool Games | Needs critical mass of public gardens |
| **Creator Education** | Skool has Alex Hormozi, huge marketing budget | Commune needs creator evangelists |
| **Ease of Use** | Substack is dead simple (just write) | Knowledge graph has learning curve |
| **Platform Maturity** | Ghost/Substack have 5+ years of polish | Commune is new, needs feature parity |
| **Payment Infrastructure** | Patreon/Stripe handle global payments | Commune needs strong Stripe integration |


## 8. 2025 Creator Economy Macro Trends

### Trend: Creator Exhaustion with Algorithm Dependency
**Stat**: 93% of creators say platform dependency negatively impacts their lives
**Implication**: Creators increasingly want **direct audience relationships** (email, custom domain, self-hosted)
**Commune Opportunity**: Position as "anti-algorithm" — knowledge graph discovery, not engagement-bait


### Trend: Revenue Diversification
**Stat**: 83% of creators want multiple revenue streams (not just one platform)
**Implication**: Platforms offering **just subscriptions** lose to platforms with memberships + courses + affiliates + ads
**Commune Opportunity**: Allow multiple monetization (paid notes, paid communities, course bundling, affiliate backlinks)


### Trend: Ownership & Portability
**Stat**: 99% of creators say content control is crucial
**Implication**: Data export, custom domains, self-hosted options are **table stakes** for serious creators
**Commune Opportunity**: Make data portability a headline feature, not fine print


### Trend: Consolidation to 10% Platform Fee
**Stat**: Gumroad, Patreon, Substack all at 10%
**Implication**: Market accepts 10% as "fair" for platform-hosted solutions
**Commune Opportunity**: Undercut at Village tier (10% beats Substack's hidden 16%), eliminate at City tier (0% beats everyone)


### Trend: Democratization via Low Entry Pricing
**Stat**: Skool Hobby ($9), beehiiv free tier, Kit free tier
**Implication**: Creators expect **free or <$15/mo to start**, then pay more as they grow
**Commune Opportunity**: Free Garden tier + $9 Village tier captures market


### Trend: Self-Hosted Renaissance
**Stat**: Ghost, beehiiv show creators willing to pay more monthly for 0% revenue share
**Implication**: At scale, **SaaS fees beat percentage fees** ($99/mo < 10% of $10K MRR)
**Commune Opportunity**: City tier at $99/mo with 0% platform fee is competitive with Ghost, better UX than self-hosted

## Conclusion

The 2024-2025 creator platform landscape is consolidating around **10% platform fees** as the industry standard, but creators are increasingly frustrated with:
1. **Hidden fees** (Stripe fees, currency conversion, payout fees on top of platform fees)
2. **Platform lock-in** (difficulty exporting data, no custom domains on low tiers)
3. **Scaling economics** (percentage fees punish success)

Successful platforms are differentiating via:
- **Low-barrier entry** (Skool $9, beehiiv free, Kit free)
- **Transparent pricing** (Stripe, Ghost, beehiiv show total costs)
- **0% platform fees at scale** (Ghost, beehiiv compete on SaaS monthly fees instead of revenue share)
- **Data portability** (Ghost, beehiiv, Kit allow full exports)
- **Engagement innovation** (Skool's gamification, beehiiv's ad network)

**For Commune**, the opportunity is to:
1. **Undercut on fees** (0% platform fee at City tier beats Substack/Patreon/Skool at scale)
2. **Over-deliver on entry** (custom domain on $9 Village tier, beats Skool Hobby)
3. **Differentiate on depth** (knowledge graph + gamification for intellectual rigor, not just likes)
4. **Build trust** (radical fee transparency, full data portability, no exit penalties)

The winning pricing strategy combines **accessibility** (free/low entry), **transparency** (show all fees upfront), **scaling economics** (0% platform fee at scale), and **ownership** (custom domain, data export) — positioning Commune as the platform for serious knowledge creators who want to build, own, and monetize their intellectual capital without platform tax.


**Next Steps for Commune**:
1. Validate pricing assumptions with beta creators (test $9 vs. $15 Village tier)
2. Build fee calculator (show total cost at various MRR levels)
3. Implement Stripe integration (ensure 0% Commune fee is technically feasible)
4. Design upgrade prompts (auto-suggest City tier when Village fees exceed $99/mo)
5. Create comparison marketing (position vs. Skool, Substack, Ghost)
6. Develop data export tooling (make portability a trust-builder)
7. Build knowledge graph discovery engine (differentiate from generic content platforms)
